The Dyer laboratory is a research lab at [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://vcu.edu) that focuses on developing and testing tools to aid in understand how landscape features influence genetic connectivity. This requires a mix of theory development, software creation, and evaluation using (largely) non-model systems in the field.
