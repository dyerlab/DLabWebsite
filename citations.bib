 abstract = {Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of
genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system,
which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and
outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to
the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest
management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest
management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem
Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering
dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant
and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In
1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida
individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar
to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management
treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the
management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study
trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because
differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental
factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on
a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the
rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective
number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the
hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence
on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among
mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest
treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single
locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective
number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management
treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with
local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local
familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating
was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show
that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on
insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could
be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator
behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on
gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as
management treatments are continued and further studies on additional
plant species.},

 abstract = {Patterns of spatial genetic structure produced following the expansion
of an invasive species into novel habitats reflect demographic processes
that have shaped the genetic structure we see today. We examined 359
individuals from 23 populations over 370 km within the James River Basin
of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin.
Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using
several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for
three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two
distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the
basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system
advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found
suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However,
surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations
suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive
species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may
provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead
to better management strategies for control and eradication.},

 abstract = {Sex-specific genetic structure is a commonly observed pattern among
vertebrate species. Facing differential selective pressures, individuals
may adopt sex-specific life history traits that ultimately shape genetic
variation among populations. Although differential dispersal dynamics
are commonly detected in the literature, few studies have used genetic
structure to investigate sex-specific functional connectivity. The
recent use of graph theoretic approaches in landscape genetics has
demonstrated network capacities to describe complex system behaviours
where network topology represents genetic interaction among subunits.
Here, we partition the overall genetic structure into sex-specific
graphs, revealing different male and female dispersal dynamics of a
fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) metapopulation in southern Ontario.
Our analyses based on network topologies supported the hypothesis of
male-biased dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of
the landscape, identified at the population level, could be partitioned
among sex-specific strata. We found that female connectivity was
negatively correlated with snow depth, whereas connectivity among males
was not. Our findings underscore the potential of conducting
sex-specific analysis by identifying landscape elements or configuration
that differentially promotes or impedes functional connectivity between
sexes, revealing processes that may otherwise remain cryptic. We propose
that the sex-specific graph approach would be applicable to other vagile
species where differential sex-specific processes are expected to occur.},

Abstract = {{Understanding migratory connectivity is essential for determining the
   drivers behind population dynamics and for implementing effective
   conservation strategies for migratory species. Genetic markers provide a
   means to describe migratory connectivity; however, they can be
   uninformative for species with weak population genetic structure, which
   has limited their application. Here, we demonstrated a genomic approach
   to describing migratory connectivity in the prothonotary warbler,
   Protonotaria citrea, a Neotropical songbird of conservation concern.
   Using 26,189 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we revealed
   regional genetic structure between the Mississippi River Valley and the
   Atlantic Seaboard with overall weak genetic differentiation among
   populations (F-ST = 0.0055; 95\% CI: 0.0051-0.0059). Genetic variation
   had a stronger association with geographic rather than environmental
   factors, with each explaining 14.5\% and 8.2\% of genetic variation,
   respectively. By varying the numbers of genomic markers used in
   population assignment models with individuals of known provenance, we
   identified a maximum assignment accuracy (89.7\% to site, 94.3\% to
   region) using a subset of 600 highly differentiated SNPs. We then
   assigned samples from nonbreeding sites to breeding region and found low
   migratory connectivity. Our results highlight the importance of
   filtering markers for informative loci in models of population
   assignment. Quantifying migratory connectivity for weakly structured
   species will be useful for expanding studies to a wider range of
   migratory species across taxonomic groups and may contribute to a deeper
   understanding of the evolution of migratory strategies.}},

@article{ DiLeoEtAl2014,
 abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure
in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and
site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived
attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important
role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of
landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the
effects of interindividual distance using spatial and increasingly
ecological separation, yet have not incorporated individual plant
characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially
explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion
of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the
statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon
examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site
characteristics provided better models than those that only considered
interindividual spatial distance (e.g. IBD). Models parameterized using
conditional genetic covariance (e.g. population graphs) also
outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus
florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site
characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal
tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better
models describing gene flow than models including only between-site
spatial (IBD) and ecological (isolation by resistance) variables.
Overall, our results show that including interindividual and local
ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level
measures of contemporary gene flow.},

particular emphasis to the phase transition that occurs when populations
begin to become fixed due to restricted movement of genes among
populations. I close by discussing the utility of this method for the

evolution of plant populations. However, the mechanisms controlling
either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process
may be influenced by site-specific factors such as local forest
structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here, we present an
extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed TWOGENER
analysis of pollen pool structure. This model, dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA
(StAMOVA), focuses on determining to what extent ecological,
demographic, and/or environmental factors influence the observed genetic
variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified
for efficacy, using an extensive battery of simulations, illustrating: (
1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation
of spatially separated pollen pools, and ( 2) how effectively the
Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections.
Finally, the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set, from which we
have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly
distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set, we show
how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial
adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast
these results with those derived from the original TWOGENER analysis.},

 abstract = {Landscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how
site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation
and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this
manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape
genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived
from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially
confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic
history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based
simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of
genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic
distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional
stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance
D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract
the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape
genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert
succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed
phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii,
removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences
our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of
spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic
analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic
analyses.},

 abstract = {The manner by which pollinators move across a landscape and their
resulting preferences and/or avoidances of travel through particular
habitat types can have a significant impact on plant population genetic
structure and population-level connectivity. We examined the spatial
genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae)
adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two
mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic
covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident
adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively
autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of
restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small
(s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) =
0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open
canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced
by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial
distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was
quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a
network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance.
The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive
relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through
C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy
(e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy),
and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species
cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within
stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations
are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and
quality of intervening canopy cover.},

Traditionally, population geneticists have used methods such as
F-statistics, pairwise isolation by distance models, spatial
autocorrelation and coalescent models to analyse this variation and to
gain insight about causal evolutionary processes. Here we introduce a
novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of
marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework.
This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic
summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the
complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic
interactions among populations. We introduce the application of
Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic
structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this
data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance,
isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of
specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by

 abstract = {Pollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree
species. Because pollen movement influences the creation, maintenance
and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations, it is important
to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement.
Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly
structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers.
Extrinsic factors, such as the intervening vegetative structure and
local pollen donor densities, can also influence the genetic composition
of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast
microsatellite markers, we examined the structure and diversity of
pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri, USA. Our
analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands
(approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate
to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen
pool within regions (phi (SR) = 0.095), but not among regions (phi (RT)
= 0.010), indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted.
Furthermore, the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and
physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho = 0.32) provided support for
the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that
availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen
pool, measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each
stand. However, pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with
vegetative structure, measured as total forest tree density. Our
findings indicated that on-going pollen movement within continuous
forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by
distance and vegetative structure.},

@article{ EckertDyer2012,
 abstract = {Whether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the
spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a
landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The
tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped
onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The
characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which
is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and
thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e.
metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its
distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective
pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus
be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant
populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of
attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative
genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species.
What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In
this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the
first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us
closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive
phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
Dougl. ex Loud.).},

@article{ Flores-ManzaneroEtAl2019,
 abstract = {Gene flow in animals is limited or facilitated by different features
within the landscape matrix they inhabit. The landscape representation
in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance
surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for
assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also,
desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We
addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the
effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the
desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity
and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and
movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents,
generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based
on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these
variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and
structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by
first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic
inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface
(NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of
individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity.
Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed
that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs.
categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization
framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation
cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami's
functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could
further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity
observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between
environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami's behavior and
physiology.},

Abstract = {{The European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) was first introduced to
   Massachusetts in 1869 and within 150 years has spread throughout eastern
   North America. This large-scale invasion across a heterogeneous
   landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation
   potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the
   hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven
   observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a
   common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a
   latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated
   genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double
   digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to
   discover genome-wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for
   signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic
   structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude
   (F-ST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion
   apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results
   from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent
   with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further
   analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on
   larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium
   component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns.
   The populations most important for these signals were two range-edge
   populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the
   importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non-native
   species to invade novel environments.}},

@article{ GarrickEtAl2009_MolEcol,
 abstract = {To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient
vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the
Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly
distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of
fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja
floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also
examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales.
Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing
and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical
signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six
codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a
scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago
(Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting
events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c.
3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade
phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based
inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which
phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong
evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the
Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region,
however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly
northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation
of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and
geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape
context.},

@article{ GarrickEtAl2010,
 abstract = {Background: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is
to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate
which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common
practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the
implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the
haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of
phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five
non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular
approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key
issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of
inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that
drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting
unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and
the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses.
Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e.,
a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were
incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with
high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and
genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were
disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The
standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream
analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic
diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with
larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this
causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic
parameters.
Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches
for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications
is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential
impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic
inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that
enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles
from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and
effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.},

 abstract = {Ecologically interacting species may have phylogeographical histories
that are shaped both by features of their abiotic landscape and by
biotic constraints imposed by their coassociation. The Baja California
peninsula provides an excellent opportunity to examine the influence of
abiotic vs. biotic factors on patterns of diversity in plant-insect
species. This is because past climatic and geological changes impacted
the genetic structure of plants quite differently to that of
codistributed free-living animals (e.g. herpetofauna and small mammals).
Thus, plant-like' patterns should be discernible in host-specific insect
herbivores. Here, we investigate the population history of a monophagous
bark beetle, Araptus attenuatus, and consider drivers of
phylogeographical patterns in the light of previous work on its host
plant, Euphorbia lomelii. Using a combination of phylogenetic,
coalescent-simulation-based and exploratory analyses of mitochondrial
DNA sequences and nuclear genotypic data, we found that the evolutionary
history of A.attenuatus exhibits similarities to its host plant that are
attributable to both biotic and abiotic processes. Southward range
expansion and recent colonization of continental Sonora from the Baja
peninsula appear to be unique to this taxon pair and probably reflect
influences of the host plant. On the other hand, abiotic factors with
landscape-level influences on a diverse suite of codistributed
arid-adapted taxa, such as Plio- and Pleistocene-aged marine incursions
in the region, also left genetic signatures in beetle and host plant
populations. Superimposed on these similarities, bark beetle-specific
patterns and processes were also evident: our data revealed two
secondarily sympatric, reproductively isolated genetic lineages, as well
as a previously unrecognized mid-peninsular warm desert refuge. Taken
together, this work illustrates that the evolutionary history of
species-specific insect herbivores may represent a mosaic of influences,
includingbut not limited tothose imposed by the host plant.},

resulting in considerable economic loss. In the eastern United States,
five species (R. flavipes, R. virginicus, R. nelsonae, R. hageni and R.
malletei) have overlapping ranges and are difficult to distinguish
morphologically. Here we present a molecular tool for species
identification. It is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification of a section of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
subunit II gene, followed by a three-enzyme restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) assay, with banding patterns resolved via agarose
gel electrophoresis. The assay was designed using a large set of
training data obtained from a public DNA sequence database, then
evaluated using an independent test panel of Reticulitermes from the
Southern Appalachian Mountains, for which species assignments were
determined via phylogenetic comparison to reference sequences. After
refining the interpretive framework, the PCR-RFLP assay was shown to
provide accurate identification of four co-occurring species (the fifth
species, R. hageni, was absent from the test panel, so accuracy cannot
yet be extended to training data). The assay is cost- and
time-efficient, and will help improve knowledge of Reticulitermes

 abstract = {Pollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic
variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen
movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many
herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and
biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement
in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations,
located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic
disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern
Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently
developed TWOGENER analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective
number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size
(A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each
population. We extended the TWOGENER method by developing inference on
the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where
offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species
with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal
plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen
movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the
effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66)
and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the
disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen
movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in
disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects
in Trillium habitats.},

 abstract = {While floral herbivores and predispersal seed predators often reduce
plant reproductive output, their role in limiting plant fitness and
population growth is less clear, especially for iteroparous perennial
plant species. In this study we experimentally excluded floral
herbivores and predispersal seed predators (insecticide spray versus
water control) over a 2-year period to examine the effect of
inflorescence-feeding insects on levels of seed production, seedling
emergence, and juvenile establishment for Liatris cylindracea, an
iteroparous perennial plant. In addition, we collected detailed
demographic data on all life stage transitions for an additional set of
individuals in the same population over 4 years. We used the
experimental and demographic data to construct stochastic
individual-based simulations to evaluate the overall effect of
inflorescence-feeding insects on adult recruitment per maternal plant (a
fitness component) and population growth rate. The insect exclusion
experiments showed that damage due to insects decreased seed production,
seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for both years'
experiments. These results indicate that recruitment was seed-limited
through juvenile establishment, and that inflorescence-feeding insects
influenced the degree of seed limitation. Results of the
individual-based simulation models, which included individual
demographic and temporal stochasticity, showed that
inflorescence-feeding insects negatively affected the number of adult
offspring per maternal plant recruited into the population and
population growth rate for both years' experiments. Taken together, the
results of the experimental exclusions and the individual-based models
indicate that inflorescence-feeding insects can influence population
growth rate, and have the potential to act as a selective force for the
evolution of traits in this plant species.},

structure and connectivity between natural populations. Six
microsatellite loci were used to infer the population structure of 35
populations (N = 788) of the alpine Arabian burnet moth Reissita simonyi
(Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae) in Yemen and Oman. Due to the patchy
distribution of larval food plants, R. simonyi is not continuously
distributed throughout the studied area and the two recognized
subspecies of this endemic species (Reissita s. simonyi/R. s.
yemenicola) are apparently discretely distributed. All microsatellites
showed prevalence of null alleles and therefore a thorough investigation
of the impact of null alleles on different population genetic parameters
(F-ST, inbreeding coefficients, and Population Graph topologies) is
given. In general, null alleles reduced genetic covariance and
independence of allele frequencies resulting in a more connected genetic
topology in Population Graphs and an overestimation of pairwise F-ST
values and inbreeding coefficients. Despite the presence of null
alleles, Population Graphs also showed a much higher genetic
connectivity within subspecies (and lower genetic differentiation (via
F-ST)) than between; supporting existing taxonomic distinction. Partial
Mantel tests showed that both geographical distance and altitude were
highly correlated with the observed distribution of genetic structure
within R. simonyi. In conclusion, we identified geographical and
altitudinal distances in R. simonyi as well as an intervening desert
area to be the main factors for spatial genetic structure in this
species and show that the taxonomic division into two subspecies is
confirmed by genetic analysis.},

 abstract = {Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations,
reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all
of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene
flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an
urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to
thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated
transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic
approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic
connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model
of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide
polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD
(ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban
and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United
States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic,
and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population
genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and
higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show
that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs
that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of
historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban
facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of
sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that
urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape
continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors
influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black
widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.},

 abstract = {As urbanization drastically alters the natural landscape and generates
novel habitats within cities, the potential for changes to gene flow for
urban-dwelling species increases. The western black widow spider
(Latrodectus hesperus) is a medically relevant urban adapter pest
species, for which we have previously identified population genetic
signatures consistent with urbanization facilitating gene flow, likely
due to human-mediated transport. Here, in an analysis of 1.9 million
genome-wide SNPs, we contrast broad-scale geographical analyses of 10
urban and 11 non-urban locales with fine-scale within-city analyses
including 30 urban locales across the western USA. These hierarchical
datasets enable us to test hypotheses of how urbanization impacts
multiple urban cities and their genetic connectivity at different
spatial scales. Coupled fine-scale and broad-scale analyses reveal
contrasting patterns of high and low genetic differentiation among
locales within cities as a result of low and high genetic connectivity,
respectively, of these cities to the overall population network. We
discuss these results as they challenge the use of cities as replicates
of urban eco-evolution, and have implications for conservation and human
health in a rapidly growing urban habitat.},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of
   which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and
   pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity
   can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and
   decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old
   (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed
   reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and
   restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br.
   (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and
   graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five
   remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using
   microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were
   assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination
   graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations
   had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations
   (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between
   restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other
   pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01;
   n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity
   (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances
   (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate
   reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of
   B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance
   pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates
   their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent
   to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.}},

@article{ SmouseEtAl2001,
 abstract = {Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially
distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in
microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in
the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real
time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation
(parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener)
that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools
sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate
mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we
describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate
intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine
whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling
considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by
simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in
male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT), a male gametic analogue of
Wright's F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We
illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically
or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level
of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous
case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic
resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus
alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) = 0.06,
translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an
effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m.
Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously
realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This
case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey
and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about
landscape-level gene movements.},

 abstract = {The fragmented populations and reduced population densities that result
from human disturbance are issues of growing importance in evolutionary
and conservation biology. A key issue is whether remnant individuals
become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata )
is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly
jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied
pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick
Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen
donors (N (ep) ) and average distance of effective pollen movement
(delta). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of
paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and
progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N (ep) = 3.68
individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we
assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen
dispersal distance (delta) and estimated delta= 64.8 m. We then deployed
our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick
population to evaluate the extent to which N (ep) may have changed, as a
consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999.
Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N
(ep) was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both
estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for
wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results
presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling
pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic
attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak
resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic
isolation.},

@article{ SorkEtAl2005,
 abstract = {Anthropogenic landscape change can disrupt gene flow. As part of the
Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, this study examined whether
silvicultural practices influence pollen-mediated gene movement in the
insect-pollinated species, Cornus florida L., by comparing pollen pool
structure (Phi(st)) among clear-cutting, selective cutting, and uncut
regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the
uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings - 10 each from 150 seed
parents (43 in clear-cut, 74 in selective, and 33 in control sites) from
six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha), eight allozyme loci were
analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as TWOGENER (Smouse
et al., 2001; Evolution 55: 260-271). This analysis revealed that pollen
pool structure was less in clear-cut ((Phi) over circle (C) = 0.090, P <
0.001) than in uncut areas ((Phi) over cap (U) = 0.174, P < 0.001), with
selective-cut intermediate ((Phi) over circles = 0.125, P < 0.001).
These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N(ep)) in
clear-cut (N(ep) = 5.56) and selective-cut (N(ep) = 4.00) areas than in
uncut areas (N(ep) = 2.87). We demonstrate that Phi(C) less than or
equal to Phi(S) less than or equal to Phi(U), with (Phi) over circle
(C), significantly smaller than (Phi) over circle (U) (P < 0.034). The
findings imply that, as long as a sufficiently large number of seed
parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic
bottleneck in the effective number of mothers, silvicultural management
may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents, and
hence subsequent genetic diversity in Cornus florida.},

This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we

fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of
landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic

defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation
for tree species in the application of this approach toward
understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review
traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation
and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we
present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic

 abstract = {Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), although prevalent in some avian
taxa, is easily overlooked when it occurs in low frequencies, and
therefore the ecology of this behavior has only occasionally been
described in passerines. We describe the occurrence of CBP in a
population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding in
nest boxes, demonstrate associated fitness costs, and investigate
parasite strategy. We genotyped individuals at 6 microsatellite loci and
used Cervus software to determine log-likelihood of maternity (LOD
scores) for offspring and social mothers. We set critical cutoff LOD
scores at 95% confidence for exclusion of the social mother and
assignment of a parasite mother from the breeding population. Of 805
nestlings (233 family groups during 2009-2013), we found that 12.7% had
genotypes that were incompatible with their social mother. Females with
unrelated nestlings (hosts) fledged fewer biological offspring within
the host year than nonhost females despite fledging more total
offspring, but being a host was not significantly associated with total
reproductive success over 5 yr of breeding. We were able to identify
only similar to 30% of parasite females, which suggests that the
majority of parasites may be floaters (i.e. non-nesters) in the
population or nesting in nearby natural cavities. We found no evidence
of host selection based on host age, arrival at the breeding site, or
nest-box productivity in the previous year. This opportunistic behavior
is likely facilitated by the nesting ecology of this population, in that
nest sites are limited, conspicuous, and relatively dense. Future
studies investigating CBP in populations using natural cavities can help

 abstract = {The recognition that communal roosts are important elements within the
life cycle of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) led to their
protection under the ``disturb″ clause of the Bald and Golden Eagle
Protection Act. The regular roost-switching movements of bald eagles
imply that roosts are part of an interactive network where roosts
represent nodes linked by birds moving between them. Network analysis
holds promise for informing management decisions by assessing the effect
of roost removal on the resilience of the broader network. We tracked
nonbreeding bald eagles (n = 56) within the upper Chesapeake Bay
(2008-2013), USA, to evaluate roost characteristics and network
structure. We used midnight locations (n = 14,464) to assess the use of
communal roosts (n = 212) and movement of birds among roosts (n = 2,634)
on successive roost nights to evaluate the pattern and strength of
connections. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the response
of the roost network to roost loss. Structure of the roost network
approximated that of a scale-free network where the distribution of
connections follows a power law of the form P(k)=Ak(-gamma) and gamma =
1.1. Unlike random networks, connections within scale-free networks are
concentrated within a few highly connected nodes (hubs). These hub
roosts serve as bridges between large numbers of other roosts, have the
shortest travel times to other roosts and greatest overall influence on
network functioning. The effect of roost removal on overall network
function was directly proportional to the connectivity of the roost
being removed. The targeted removal of the majority (>90%) of roosts
had very little effect on the network. Network sensitivity was high in
response to the loss of roosts within the highest 10% of connectivity.
This small (n = 18) subset of roosts makes a disproportionate
contribution to network function and the protection of these roosts
should be a stated management objective with high priority. Network
analysis represents a powerful tool with the potential to inform
management decisions. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{ YangEtAl2015,
 abstract = {Mountains as natural barriers often have important effects on
intraspecific genetic structure through restraining gene flow and
enhancing differentiation among populations. While the Qinling and Daba
mountains are considered significant geographic barriers, dividing China
into temperate and subtropical regions, little is known about how this
barrier influences the genetic patterns of sister species represented in
distinct habitats. In this study, we analyzed genetic differentiation
and the geographic boundary between Pinus henryi and Pinus tabuliformis
using chloroplast microsatellite markers. Our data show high levels of
among-population differentiation, consistent with the effects of
historical demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and climate
effects. Three main geographic boundaries coinciding with mountain
systems indicate natural landscapes, such as large rivers, and habitat
loss caused by anthropogenic deforestation, are significant barriers to
genetic exchange among populations. The divergence between populations
in the eastern and western Qinling Mountains populations may possibly be
ascribed to fragmentation driven by climate change. The genetic boundary
of P. henryi and P. tabuliformis generally coincides with the previous
morphological dividing line based on the unweighted pair group method
using arithmetic averages and on spatial analysis of molecular variance.

   abstract = {© 2021 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. As human-induced change eliminates natural habitats, it impacts genetic diversity and population connectivity for local biodiversity. The South African Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is the most diverse extratropical area for plant biodiversity, and much of its habitat is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. There has long been great interest in explaining the underlying factors driving this unique diversity, especially as much of the CFR is endangered by urbanization and other anthropogenic activity. Here, we use a population and landscape genetic analysis of SNP data from the CFR endemic plant Leucadendron salignum or “common sunshine conebush” as a model to address the evolutionary and environmental factors shaping the vast CFR diversity. We found that high population structure, along with relatively deeper and older genealogies, is characteristic of the southwestern CFR, whereas low population structure and more recent lineage coalescence depict the eastern CFR. Population network analyses show genetic connectivity is facilitated in areas of lower elevation and higher seasonal precipitation. These population genetic signatures corroborate CFR species-level patterns consistent with high Pleistocene biome stability and landscape heterogeneity in the southwest, but with coincident instability in the east. Finally, we also find evidence of human land-usage as a significant gene flow barrier, especially in severely threatened lowlands where genetic connectivity has been historically the highest. These results help identify areas where conservation plans can prioritize protecting high genetic diversity threatened by contemporary human activities within this unique cultural UNESCO site.},

The main focus here is on the discussion of approaches and examples showing how population genetic structure can be influenced by spatial and ecologically heterogeneity. The chapter presents case studies directed towards the biological inferences regarding population genetic structure that are gained from the inclusion of spatial and ecological contexts. It takes a broader, and perhaps more comprehensive, view of what would be considered landscape genetics than is commonly used. An arbitrary partition is imposed in the chapter based on the spatial and temporal extent of the processes being examined, either contemporary or historical, straddling both population genetic and phylogeographic domains. The chapter closes with a short discussion on future research and potentially understudied aspects of plant landscape genetic analyses.},

Landscape genetic data are by nature graph-like in structure; graph approaches are extremely powerful for a wide range of landscape genetic applications. Graph applications have great potential to address landscape genetics questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. This chapter discusses three applications of graph approaches: using graph methods to describe population genetic structure, testing hypotheses of gene flow among nodes, and assessing functional connectivity using a graph structure. Graph applications in landscape genetics have vast potential. The chapter analyzes several important considerations for researchers and managers wishing to apply graphs in a landscape genetics context. In graphs based upon statistical models, like population graphs, the statistical power of the analysis is based upon the sampling. In a graph analysis, it is possible to identify which nodes are most important to graph structure, what nodes are needed to maintain connectivity, and how the landscape impedes or promotes connectivity through the network.},

   abstract = {Background: Despite constant progress, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. The ability of tumors to metastasize is central to this dilemma, as many studies demonstrate successful treatment correlating to diagnosis prior to cancer spread. Hence a better understanding of cancer invasiveness and metastasis could provide critical insight. Presentation of the hypothesis. We hypothesize that a systems biology-based comparison of cancer invasiveness and suburban sprawl will reveal similarities that are instructive. Testing the hypothesis. We compare the structure and behavior of invasive cancer to suburban sprawl development. While these two systems differ vastly in dimension, they appear to adhere to scale-invariant laws consistent with invasive behavior in general. We demonstrate that cancer and sprawl have striking similarities in their natural history, initiating factors, patterns of invasion, vessel distribution and even methods of causing death. Implications of the hypothesis. We propose that metastatic cancer and suburban sprawl provide striking analogs in invasive behavior, to the extent that conclusions from one system could be predictive of behavior in the other. We suggest ways in which this model could be used to advance our understanding of cancer biology and treatment. © 2010Ryan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {In plants, long-distance dispersal is both attenuated and directed by specific movement vectors, including animals, wind, and/or water. Hence, movement vectors partly shape metapopulation genetic patterns that are, however, also influenced by other life-history traits such as clonal growth. We studied the relationship between area, isolation, plant-species richness, reproduction, and dispersal mechanisms with genetic diversity and divergence in 4 widespread wetland plant-species in a total of 20 island-like kettle-hole habitats surrounded by an intensive agricultural landscape. Our results showed that genetic parameters reflect the reproduction strategies with the highest genetic diversity being observed in the non-clonal, outcrossing Oenanthe aquatica compared to the clonal Lycopus europaeus, Typha latifolia, and Phragmites australis. Lycopus showed a positive relationship between genetic diversity and kettle-hole area, but a negative relationship with the number of neighboring kettle holes (less isolation). Genetic diversity increased with plant-species richness in the clonal species Phragmites and Lycopus; while it decreased in the non-clonal Oenanthe. Finally, genetic divergence and, therefore, connectivity differed between alternative dispersal strategies, where wind-dispersed Typha and Phragmites had a higher gene flow between the analyzed kettle holes compared with the insect-pollinated, hydrochorous Lycopus and Oenanthe. Our study provides information on genetic patterns related to reproduction and dispersal mechanisms of 4 common wetland species contributing to the understanding of the functioning of plant metacommunities occurring in kettle holes embedded in agricultural landscapes.},
