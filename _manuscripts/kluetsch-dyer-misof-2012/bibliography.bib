 abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and landscape topology may influence the genetic
structure and connectivity between natural populations. Six
microsatellite loci were used to infer the population structure of 35
populations (N = 788) of the alpine Arabian burnet moth Reissita simonyi
(Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae) in Yemen and Oman. Due to the patchy
distribution of larval food plants, R. simonyi is not continuously
distributed throughout the studied area and the two recognized
subspecies of this endemic species (Reissita s. simonyi/R. s.
yemenicola) are apparently discretely distributed. All microsatellites
showed prevalence of null alleles and therefore a thorough investigation
of the impact of null alleles on different population genetic parameters
(F-ST, inbreeding coefficients, and Population Graph topologies) is
given. In general, null alleles reduced genetic covariance and
independence of allele frequencies resulting in a more connected genetic
topology in Population Graphs and an overestimation of pairwise F-ST
values and inbreeding coefficients. Despite the presence of null
alleles, Population Graphs also showed a much higher genetic
connectivity within subspecies (and lower genetic differentiation (via
F-ST)) than between; supporting existing taxonomic distinction. Partial
Mantel tests showed that both geographical distance and altitude were
highly correlated with the observed distribution of genetic structure
within R. simonyi. In conclusion, we identified geographical and
altitudinal distances in R. simonyi as well as an intervening desert
area to be the main factors for spatial genetic structure in this
species and show that the taxonomic division into two subspecies is
confirmed by genetic analysis.},
