 abstract = {This manuscript explores the simultaneous evolution of population
genetic parameters and topological features within a population graph
through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. I show that node centrality
and graph breadth are significantly correlated to population genetic
parameters Phi(ST) and M (p = -0.95; p = -0.98, respectively), which are
commonly used in quantifying among population genetic structure and
isolation by distance. Next, the topological consequences of migration
patterns are examined by contrasting N-island and stepping stone models
of gene movement. Finally, I show how variation in migration rate
influences the rate of formation of specific topological features with
particular emphasis to the phase transition that occurs when populations
begin to become fixed due to restricted movement of genes among
populations. I close by discussing the utility of this method for the
analysis of intraspecific genetic variation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All
