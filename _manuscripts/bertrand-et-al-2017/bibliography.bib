 abstract = {Sex-specific genetic structure is a commonly observed pattern among
vertebrate species. Facing differential selective pressures, individuals
may adopt sex-specific life history traits that ultimately shape genetic
variation among populations. Although differential dispersal dynamics
are commonly detected in the literature, few studies have used genetic
structure to investigate sex-specific functional connectivity. The
recent use of graph theoretic approaches in landscape genetics has
demonstrated network capacities to describe complex system behaviours
where network topology represents genetic interaction among subunits.
Here, we partition the overall genetic structure into sex-specific
graphs, revealing different male and female dispersal dynamics of a
fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) metapopulation in southern Ontario.
Our analyses based on network topologies supported the hypothesis of
male-biased dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of
the landscape, identified at the population level, could be partitioned
among sex-specific strata. We found that female connectivity was
negatively correlated with snow depth, whereas connectivity among males
was not. Our findings underscore the potential of conducting
sex-specific analysis by identifying landscape elements or configuration
that differentially promotes or impedes functional connectivity between
sexes, revealing processes that may otherwise remain cryptic. We propose
that the sex-specific graph approach would be applicable to other vagile
species where differential sex-specific processes are expected to occur.},
