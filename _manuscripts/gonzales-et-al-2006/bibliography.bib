 abstract = {Pollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic
variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen
movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many
herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and
biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement
in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations,
located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic
disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern
Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently
developed TWOGENER analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective
number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size
(A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each
population. We extended the TWOGENER method by developing inference on
the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where
offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species
with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal
plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen
movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the
effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66)
and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the
disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen
movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in
disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects
in Trillium habitats.},
