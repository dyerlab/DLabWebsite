 abstract = {The server-based program GENER performs the two-generation analysis of
pollen flow for data consisting of mother/offspring arrays using genetic
markers. The GENER program decomposes the genetic variance sampled by
maternal individuals within and among pollen pool components of genetic
variance and is accessible from http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu. These
estimates are used to construct the test statistic, Phi(FT), whose
significance is tested via permutation. The Phi(FT) statistic can
subsequently be used to quantify genetic effective pollen donor
population size (N-ep), effective mating area and dispersal distance.
Furthermore, the GENER program can calculate Phi(FT) values for all
pairs of substrata within the data set.},
