description: "We developed seven nuclear intron markers for Euphorbia lomelii. New exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) oligonucleotides were used for initial amplification and sequencing, then locus-specific primers and restriction-fragment-length polymorphism genotyping assays were designed. Loci showed no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, and they cross-amplify in at least three congeneric species."
