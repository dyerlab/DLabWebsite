 abstract = {For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary, it must satisfy two
conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing
disciplines, and it must be able to provide insights, through this
interaction, that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this
study, I examine the complete body of peer-reviewed literature
self-identified as landscape genetics (LG) using the statistical
approaches of text mining and natural language processing. The goal here
was to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in LG studies,
the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they
are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology
and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within
published LG studies examining the extent to which emergent questions
are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing
individual- and population-based approaches. I close by providing some
suggestions on where theoretical and analytical work is needed if LGs is
to serve as a real bridge connecting evolution and ecology sensu lato.},
