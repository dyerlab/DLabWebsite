 abstract = {Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations,
reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all
of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene
flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an
urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to
thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated
transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic
approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic
connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model
of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide
polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD
(ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban
and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United
States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic,
and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population
genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and
higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show
that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs
that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of
historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban
facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of
sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that
urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape
continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors
influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black
widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.},
