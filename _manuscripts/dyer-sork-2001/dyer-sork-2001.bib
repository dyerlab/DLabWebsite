 abstract = {Pollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree
species. Because pollen movement influences the creation, maintenance
and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations, it is important
to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement.
Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly
structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers.
Extrinsic factors, such as the intervening vegetative structure and
local pollen donor densities, can also influence the genetic composition
of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast
microsatellite markers, we examined the structure and diversity of
pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri, USA. Our
analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands
(approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate
to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen
pool within regions (phi (SR) = 0.095), but not among regions (phi (RT)
= 0.010), indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted.
Furthermore, the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and
physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho = 0.32) provided support for
the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that
availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen
pool, measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each
stand. However, pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with
vegetative structure, measured as total forest tree density. Our
findings indicated that on-going pollen movement within continuous
forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by
distance and vegetative structure.},
