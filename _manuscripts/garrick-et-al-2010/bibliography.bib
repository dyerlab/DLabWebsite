 abstract = {Background: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is
to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate
which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common
practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the
implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the
haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of
phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five
non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular
approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key
issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of
inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that
drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting
unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and
the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses.
Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e.,
a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were
incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with
high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and
genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were
disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The
standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream
analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic
diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with
larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this
causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic
parameters.
Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches
for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications
is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential
impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic
inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that
enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles
from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and
effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.},
