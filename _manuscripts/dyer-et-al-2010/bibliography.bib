 abstract = {Landscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how
site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation
and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this
manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape
genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived
from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially
confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic
history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based
simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of
genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic
distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional
stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance
D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract
the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape
genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert
succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed
phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii,
removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences
our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of
spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic
analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic
analyses.},
