Abstract = {{Understanding migratory connectivity is essential for determining the
   drivers behind population dynamics and for implementing effective
   conservation strategies for migratory species. Genetic markers provide a
   means to describe migratory connectivity; however, they can be
   uninformative for species with weak population genetic structure, which
   has limited their application. Here, we demonstrated a genomic approach
   to describing migratory connectivity in the prothonotary warbler,
   Protonotaria citrea, a Neotropical songbird of conservation concern.
   Using 26,189 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we revealed
   regional genetic structure between the Mississippi River Valley and the
   Atlantic Seaboard with overall weak genetic differentiation among
   populations (F-ST = 0.0055; 95\% CI: 0.0051-0.0059). Genetic variation
   had a stronger association with geographic rather than environmental
   factors, with each explaining 14.5\% and 8.2\% of genetic variation,
   respectively. By varying the numbers of genomic markers used in
   population assignment models with individuals of known provenance, we
   identified a maximum assignment accuracy (89.7\% to site, 94.3\% to
   region) using a subset of 600 highly differentiated SNPs. We then
   assigned samples from nonbreeding sites to breeding region and found low
   migratory connectivity. Our results highlight the importance of
   filtering markers for informative loci in models of population
   assignment. Quantifying migratory connectivity for weakly structured
   species will be useful for expanding studies to a wider range of
   migratory species across taxonomic groups and may contribute to a deeper
   understanding of the evolution of migratory strategies.}},
