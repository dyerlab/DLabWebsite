 abstract = {Whether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the
spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a
landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The
tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped
onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The
characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which
is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and
thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e.
metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its
distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective
pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus
be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant
populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of
attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative
genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species.
What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In
this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the
first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us
closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive
phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
Dougl. ex Loud.).},
