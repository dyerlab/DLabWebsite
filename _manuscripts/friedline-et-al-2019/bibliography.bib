Abstract = {{The European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) was first introduced to
   Massachusetts in 1869 and within 150 years has spread throughout eastern
   North America. This large-scale invasion across a heterogeneous
   landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation
   potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the
   hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven
   observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a
   common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a
   latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated
   genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double
   digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to
   discover genome-wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for
   signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic
   structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude
   (F-ST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion
   apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results
   from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent
   with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further
   analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on
   larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium
   component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns.
   The populations most important for these signals were two range-edge
   populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the
   importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non-native
   species to invade novel environments.}},
