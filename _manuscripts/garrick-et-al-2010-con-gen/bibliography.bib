 abstract = {We report eight new co-dominant nuclear markers for population genetics
of the bark beetle Araptus attenuatus Wood. Several loci include introns
from low-copy genes, and four cross-amplify in one or more related
genera. The markers show moderate levels of polymorphism (2-19 alleles
per locus), and no loci showed significant deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg or linkage equilibrium across both of the two populations
examined, consistent with Mendelian inheritance patterns.},
