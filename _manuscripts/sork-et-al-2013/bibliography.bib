 abstract = {The Forest ecosystem genomics Research: supporTing Transatlantic
Cooperation project (FoResTTraC, http://www.foresttrac.eu/) sponsored a
workshop in August 2010 to evaluate the potential for using a landscape
genomics approach for studying plant adaptation to the environment and
the potential of local populations for coping with changing climate.
This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we
believe forest trees offer an unparalleled opportunity to address
fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of
landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic
approaches that provide critical information needed for natural resource
management. In this paper, we will cover four topics. First, we begin by
defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation
for tree species in the application of this approach toward
understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review
traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation
and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we
present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic
analyses. Finally, we briefly touch on how these approaches can aid in
understanding practical topics such as management of tree populations
facing climate change.},
