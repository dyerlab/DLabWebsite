 abstract = {In this issue of Molecular Ecology, authors Robledo-Arnuncio & Garcia
present a compelling approach for quantifying seed dispersal in plant
populations. Building upon methods previously used for quantification of
pollen dispersal, the authors not only examine the behaviour of the
model with respect to sample sizes, dispersal distance, and the kurtosis
of the dispersal function but also provide an empirical example using
Prunus mahaleb.},
