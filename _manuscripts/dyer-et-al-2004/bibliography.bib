 abstract = {Patterns of pollen dispersal are central to both the ecology and
evolution of plant populations. However, the mechanisms controlling
either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process
may be influenced by site-specific factors such as local forest
structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here, we present an
extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed TWOGENER
analysis of pollen pool structure. This model, dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA
(StAMOVA), focuses on determining to what extent ecological,
demographic, and/or environmental factors influence the observed genetic
variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified
for efficacy, using an extensive battery of simulations, illustrating: (
1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation
of spatially separated pollen pools, and ( 2) how effectively the
Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections.
Finally, the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set, from which we
have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly
distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set, we show
how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial
adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast
these results with those derived from the original TWOGENER analysis.},
