 abstract = {Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of
genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system,
which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and
outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to
the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest
management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest
management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem
Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering
dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant
and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In
1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida
individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar
to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management
treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the
management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study
trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because
differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental
factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on
a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the
rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective
number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the
hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence
on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among
mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest
treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single
locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective
number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management
treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with
local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local
familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating
was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show
that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on
insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could
be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator
behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on
gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as
management treatments are continued and further studies on additional
plant species.},
