 abstract = {As urbanization drastically alters the natural landscape and generates
novel habitats within cities, the potential for changes to gene flow for
urban-dwelling species increases. The western black widow spider
(Latrodectus hesperus) is a medically relevant urban adapter pest
species, for which we have previously identified population genetic
signatures consistent with urbanization facilitating gene flow, likely
due to human-mediated transport. Here, in an analysis of 1.9 million
genome-wide SNPs, we contrast broad-scale geographical analyses of 10
urban and 11 non-urban locales with fine-scale within-city analyses
including 30 urban locales across the western USA. These hierarchical
datasets enable us to test hypotheses of how urbanization impacts
multiple urban cities and their genetic connectivity at different
spatial scales. Coupled fine-scale and broad-scale analyses reveal
contrasting patterns of high and low genetic differentiation among
locales within cities as a result of low and high genetic connectivity,
respectively, of these cities to the overall population network. We
discuss these results as they challenge the use of cities as replicates
of urban eco-evolution, and have implications for conservation and human
health in a rapidly growing urban habitat.},
