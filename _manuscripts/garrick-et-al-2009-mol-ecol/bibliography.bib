 abstract = {To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient
vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the
Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly
distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of
fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja
floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also
examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales.
Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing
and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical
signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six
codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a
scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago
(Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting
events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c.
3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade
phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based
inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which
phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong
evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the
Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region,
however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly
northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation
of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and
geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape
context.},
