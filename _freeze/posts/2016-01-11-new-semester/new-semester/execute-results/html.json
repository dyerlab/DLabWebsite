Here is a quick synopsis.\n\n  * Teaching _Population Genetics_, should be a ton of fun.\n  * Teaching the Distributed graduate seminar _Landscape Genetics_ again.\n  * Starting a new eDNA project with VDOT and getting a new student associated with it.\n  * Starting a new RadSEQ project on Protonotary Warblers and getting a new student to start in the fall.\n  * Starting a new Landscape Genetics NSF-funded project on gypsy moths with the Johnson Lab.  Need a technician for this one as well.\n  * The text _Applied Population Genetics_ should be released as an ebook.\n  * Should be finishing up both Jameson’s and Chitra’s theses and submitting them for publication.\n  * Moving into a new laboratory location and perhaps collapsing both our lab and the Verrelli lab into a single unit.\n \n \n \n",
