When you purchase new primers, you need to aliquot out usable volumes because repeated freeze/thaw cycles reduce RE efficiency.  Here are some guidelines:\n\n  1. Order from NEB (<http://neb.com>), they are the shiznit (n.b., that is a technical term).\n  2. Do not order the MOST CONCENTRATED  but be reasonable.  We typically do not work in the volume of needing 100,000 U/ml, be reasonable.\n  3. When you receive the shipment from NEB, aliquot and dilute such that we get 5 U in 20µl putting in 2µl stock (e.g., shoot for 2.5 U/µl).\n  4. Template DNA should be no more than 300 ng.  We DO NOT need a lot of template to start with.\n \n \n \n",
