I'll be migrating over all the little helper functions I use to this as a general require() on startup.  What it has now is an AddIn that allows you to select text and have it wrapped in the r-code markup.  I'm moving stuff between ePub and Markdown and it was needed.\n\nYou can install it as:\n\n<pre class=\"lang:r decode:true\">devtools::install_github(\"dyerlab/dlab\")</pre>\n\nthen look at the AddIns menu for wrapCode.\n \n \n \n",
