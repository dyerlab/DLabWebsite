Here is a short tutorial of how I updated my most current version to the latest available by [rstudio.org](https://www.rstudio.com/). Here is how I got it going.\n\nIf this is your first install, you need to grab the gdebi stuff\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install gdebi-core \n```\n\nNext download the latest deb from rstudio. I typically like to try out the [preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/), often stable enough to get what you want done while at the same time highlighting the latest features. When writing, it was the 1.2.1321 version.\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-ide-build/server/trusty/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.1321-amd64.deb</pre>\n\nMake sure to check the md5sum!\n\nIf you already have it running, stop it with \n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">sudo rstudio-server stop</pre>\n\nthen install the new version\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.1321-amd64.deb </pre>\n\nThis went out and grabbed some other libraries and installed everything for me then turned it back on. Since I had it already installed, that was the end of it. If this is the first time you are installing it, you can configure it following the installation guide [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015079054).\n\n<p class=\"sloc-display\">\n  <img class=\"icon-location\" aria-label=\"Location: \" aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"https://rodneydyer.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-location/location.svg\" /><span class=\"p-location\"><data class=\"p-latitude\" value=\"37.500000\"></data><data class=\"p-longitude\" value=\"-77.400000\"></data><a href=\"https://maps.wikimedia.org/#/14/37.5/-77.4\">Richmond, Virginia</a></span><br />&nbsp;\n</p>\n \n \n \n",
