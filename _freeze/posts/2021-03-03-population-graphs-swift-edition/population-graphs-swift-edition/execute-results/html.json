The long-term goals here are to leverage the upcoming advances in Augmented Reality and LiDAR at the phone/glasses level that I suspect will be more mainstream by 2023 or so.\n\n### Big Picture\n\nSo, in the long run, I’m looking to have a set of software that can do the following:\n\n- Estimate a population graph from genotype data.\n   - [ ] Write custom SVD routines linked with [Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate).\n   - [ ] Wrap in [GeneticStudio](craftdocs://open?blockId=D1B89492-9912-42FC-A789-D957E1FEF4C9&spaceId=07b940d2-163d-ebd5-c7c7-647f9d1cfbd1) interface for Genotype & Project CRUD.\n- Visualize the graph in either 2D ([SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/)), 3D ([SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/)), or in AR ([ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit)).\n   - [ ] Force directed estimation of location in 2-space\n   - [ ] Expand to 3-space\n   - [ ] Develop individual physics models for dynamical system in SpriteKit & SceneKit\n- Comprehensive set of network-based analytical output for local (node- and edge- centric) as well as global parameters.\n- Overlay spatial network on GeoTiff for prevalence/avoidance of features.\n- Chromosome walking - Use engine to analyze how population covariance changes along stretches of chromosomes from SNP-like data.\n- Population Simulation - Develop stochastic simulation background that is visualized using dynamical population graphs for hypothesis testing, where we specify a model and\n\n \n \n \n",
