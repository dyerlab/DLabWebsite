As such it is important to try to be able to grab and use spatial data to in an easy fashion.  At present, R is probably the best way to grab, visualize, and analyze spatial data. For this example, I went to <http://worldclim.org> and downloaded the elevation (altitude) for tile 13 (eastern North America) as a GeoTiff.  A GeoTiff is a specific type of image format that has spatial data contained within it.  The tile data has a pixel resolution of 30 arc seconds which puts us in the general area of ~ 1km.   First, we need to get things set up to work.\n\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true \"># Set the working directory to where you want it.\nsetwd(\"~/Downloads\")\n\n# load in the raster library\nrequire(raster)\nLoading required package: raster\nLoading required package: sp</pre>\n\n<!--more-->Then we can load in and visualize the data.\n\n<pre class=\"lang:r decode:true\">r <- raster(\"alt_13.tif\")\nplot(r)\n</pre>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-604\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rplot.png\" alt=\"Rplot\" width=\"949\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rplot.png 949w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rplot-300x227.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rplot-768x580.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\" /> \n\nWe can see what the raster relates to by looking at the extent.\n\n<pre class=\"lang:r decode:true\">extent(r)\nclass       : Extent \nxmin        : -90 \nxmax        : -60 \nymin        : 30 \nymax        : 60</pre>\n\nor its contents.\n\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true \">print(r)\nclass       : RasterLayer \ndimensions  : 3600, 3600, 12960000  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution  : 0.008333333, 0.008333333  (x, y)\nextent      : -90, -60, 30, 60  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 \ndata source : /Users/rodney/Downloads/alt_13.tif \nnames       : alt_13 \nvalues      : -98, 1961  (min, max)</pre>\n\nAnd you are off to the races.
