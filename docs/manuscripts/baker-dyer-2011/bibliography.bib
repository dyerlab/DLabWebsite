 abstract = {Patterns of spatial genetic structure produced following the expansion
of an invasive species into novel habitats reflect demographic processes
that have shaped the genetic structure we see today. We examined 359
individuals from 23 populations over 370 km within the James River Basin
of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin.
Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using
several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for
three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two
distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the
basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system
advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found
suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However,
surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations
suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive
species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may
provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead
to better management strategies for control and eradication.},
