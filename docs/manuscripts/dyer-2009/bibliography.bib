 abstract = {The analysis of genetic marker data is increasingly being conducted in
the context of the spatial arrangement of strata (e.g. populations)
necessitating a more flexible set of analysis tools. GeneticStudio
consists of four interacting programs: (i) Geno a spreadsheet-like
interface for the analysis of spatially explicit marker-based genetic
variation; (ii) Graph software for the analysis of Population Graph and
network topologies, (iii) Manteller, a general purpose for matrix
analysis program; and (iv) SNPFinder, a program for identifying single
nucleotide polymorphisms. The GeneticStudio suite is available as source
code as well as binaries for OSX and Windows and is distributed under
the GNU General Public License.},
