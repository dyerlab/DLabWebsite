 abstract = {Mountains as natural barriers often have important effects on
intraspecific genetic structure through restraining gene flow and
enhancing differentiation among populations. While the Qinling and Daba
mountains are considered significant geographic barriers, dividing China
into temperate and subtropical regions, little is known about how this
barrier influences the genetic patterns of sister species represented in
distinct habitats. In this study, we analyzed genetic differentiation
and the geographic boundary between Pinus henryi and Pinus tabuliformis
using chloroplast microsatellite markers. Our data show high levels of
among-population differentiation, consistent with the effects of
historical demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and climate
effects. Three main geographic boundaries coinciding with mountain
systems indicate natural landscapes, such as large rivers, and habitat
loss caused by anthropogenic deforestation, are significant barriers to
genetic exchange among populations. The divergence between populations
in the eastern and western Qinling Mountains populations may possibly be
ascribed to fragmentation driven by climate change. The genetic boundary
of P. henryi and P. tabuliformis generally coincides with the previous
morphological dividing line based on the unweighted pair group method
using arithmetic averages and on spatial analysis of molecular variance.
