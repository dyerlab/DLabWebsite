 abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure
in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and
site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived
attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important
role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of
landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the
effects of interindividual distance using spatial and increasingly
ecological separation, yet have not incorporated individual plant
characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially
explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion
of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the
statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon
examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site
characteristics provided better models than those that only considered
interindividual spatial distance (e.g. IBD). Models parameterized using
conditional genetic covariance (e.g. population graphs) also
outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus
florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site
characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal
tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better
models describing gene flow than models including only between-site
spatial (IBD) and ecological (isolation by resistance) variables.
Overall, our results show that including interindividual and local
ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level
measures of contemporary gene flow.},
