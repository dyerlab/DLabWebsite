 abstract = {The fragmented populations and reduced population densities that result
from human disturbance are issues of growing importance in evolutionary
and conservation biology. A key issue is whether remnant individuals
become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata )
is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly
jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied
pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick
Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen
donors (N (ep) ) and average distance of effective pollen movement
(delta). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of
paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and
progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N (ep) = 3.68
individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we
assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen
dispersal distance (delta) and estimated delta= 64.8 m. We then deployed
our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick
population to evaluate the extent to which N (ep) may have changed, as a
consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999.
Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N
(ep) was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both
estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for
wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results
presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling
pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic
attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak
resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic
isolation.},
