 abstract = {The manner by which pollinators move across a landscape and their
resulting preferences and/or avoidances of travel through particular
habitat types can have a significant impact on plant population genetic
structure and population-level connectivity. We examined the spatial
genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae)
adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two
mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic
covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident
adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively
autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of
restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small
(s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) =
0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open
canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced
by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial
distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was
quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a
network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance.
The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive
relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through
C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy
(e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy),
and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species
cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within
stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations
are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and
quality of intervening canopy cover.},
