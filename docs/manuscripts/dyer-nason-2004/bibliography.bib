 abstract = {Patterns of intraspecific genetic variation result from interactions
among both historical and contemporary evolutionary processes.
Traditionally, population geneticists have used methods such as
F-statistics, pairwise isolation by distance models, spatial
autocorrelation and coalescent models to analyse this variation and to
gain insight about causal evolutionary processes. Here we introduce a
novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of
marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework.
This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic
summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the
complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic
interactions among populations. We introduce the application of
Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic
structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this
data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance,
isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of
specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by
discussing the applicability of Population Graphs for addressing a wide
range of population genetic and phylogeographical problems.},
