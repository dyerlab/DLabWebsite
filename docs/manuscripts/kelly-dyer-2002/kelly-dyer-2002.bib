 abstract = {While floral herbivores and predispersal seed predators often reduce
plant reproductive output, their role in limiting plant fitness and
population growth is less clear, especially for iteroparous perennial
plant species. In this study we experimentally excluded floral
herbivores and predispersal seed predators (insecticide spray versus
water control) over a 2-year period to examine the effect of
inflorescence-feeding insects on levels of seed production, seedling
emergence, and juvenile establishment for Liatris cylindracea, an
iteroparous perennial plant. In addition, we collected detailed
demographic data on all life stage transitions for an additional set of
individuals in the same population over 4 years. We used the
experimental and demographic data to construct stochastic
individual-based simulations to evaluate the overall effect of
inflorescence-feeding insects on adult recruitment per maternal plant (a
fitness component) and population growth rate. The insect exclusion
experiments showed that damage due to insects decreased seed production,
seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for both years'
experiments. These results indicate that recruitment was seed-limited
through juvenile establishment, and that inflorescence-feeding insects
influenced the degree of seed limitation. Results of the
individual-based simulation models, which included individual
demographic and temporal stochasticity, showed that
inflorescence-feeding insects negatively affected the number of adult
offspring per maternal plant recruited into the population and
population growth rate for both years' experiments. Taken together, the
results of the experimental exclusions and the individual-based models
indicate that inflorescence-feeding insects can influence population
growth rate, and have the potential to act as a selective force for the
evolution of traits in this plant species.},
