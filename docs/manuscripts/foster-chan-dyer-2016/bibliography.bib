 abstract = {An agent-based model with a correlated random walk is used to explore
pollination within a forest. For abiotic dispersal, say via the wind, we
use a purely random walk where there is no correlation between
consecutive steps and for biotic dispersal, say via insect, we use a
moderate or highly correlated random walk. In particular, we examine the
differences in a number of biological measurement between a purely
random walk and a correlated random walk in terms of gene dispersal in
low and high plant densities.},
