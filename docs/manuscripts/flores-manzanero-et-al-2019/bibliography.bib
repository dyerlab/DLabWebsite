 abstract = {Gene flow in animals is limited or facilitated by different features
within the landscape matrix they inhabit. The landscape representation
in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance
surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for
assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also,
desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We
addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the
effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the
desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity
and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and
movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents,
generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based
on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these
variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and
structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by
first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic
inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface
(NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of
individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity.
Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed
that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs.
categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization
framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation
cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami's
functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could
further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity
observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between
environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami's behavior and
physiology.},
