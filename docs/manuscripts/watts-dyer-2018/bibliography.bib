 abstract = {The recognition that communal roosts are important elements within the
life cycle of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) led to their
protection under the ``disturbâ€³ clause of the Bald and Golden Eagle
Protection Act. The regular roost-switching movements of bald eagles
imply that roosts are part of an interactive network where roosts
represent nodes linked by birds moving between them. Network analysis
holds promise for informing management decisions by assessing the effect
of roost removal on the resilience of the broader network. We tracked
nonbreeding bald eagles (n = 56) within the upper Chesapeake Bay
(2008-2013), USA, to evaluate roost characteristics and network
structure. We used midnight locations (n = 14,464) to assess the use of
communal roosts (n = 212) and movement of birds among roosts (n = 2,634)
on successive roost nights to evaluate the pattern and strength of
connections. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the response
of the roost network to roost loss. Structure of the roost network
approximated that of a scale-free network where the distribution of
connections follows a power law of the form P(k)=Ak(-gamma) and gamma =
1.1. Unlike random networks, connections within scale-free networks are
concentrated within a few highly connected nodes (hubs). These hub
roosts serve as bridges between large numbers of other roosts, have the
shortest travel times to other roosts and greatest overall influence on
network functioning. The effect of roost removal on overall network
function was directly proportional to the connectivity of the roost
being removed. The targeted removal of the majority (>90%) of roosts
had very little effect on the network. Network sensitivity was high in
response to the loss of roosts within the highest 10% of connectivity.
This small (n = 18) subset of roosts makes a disproportionate
contribution to network function and the protection of these roosts
should be a stated management objective with high priority. Network
analysis represents a powerful tool with the potential to inform
management decisions. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.},
