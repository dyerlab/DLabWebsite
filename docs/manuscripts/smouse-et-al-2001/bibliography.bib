 abstract = {Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially
distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in
microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in
the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real
time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation
(parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener)
that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools
sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate
mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we
describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate
intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine
whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling
considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by
simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in
male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT), a male gametic analogue of
Wright's F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We
illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically
or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level
of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous
case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic
resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus
alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) = 0.06,
translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an
effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m.
Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously
realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This
case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey
and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about
landscape-level gene movements.},
