 abstract = {Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), although prevalent in some avian
taxa, is easily overlooked when it occurs in low frequencies, and
therefore the ecology of this behavior has only occasionally been
described in passerines. We describe the occurrence of CBP in a
population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding in
nest boxes, demonstrate associated fitness costs, and investigate
parasite strategy. We genotyped individuals at 6 microsatellite loci and
used Cervus software to determine log-likelihood of maternity (LOD
scores) for offspring and social mothers. We set critical cutoff LOD
scores at 95% confidence for exclusion of the social mother and
assignment of a parasite mother from the breeding population. Of 805
nestlings (233 family groups during 2009-2013), we found that 12.7% had
genotypes that were incompatible with their social mother. Females with
unrelated nestlings (hosts) fledged fewer biological offspring within
the host year than nonhost females despite fledging more total
offspring, but being a host was not significantly associated with total
reproductive success over 5 yr of breeding. We were able to identify
only similar to 30% of parasite females, which suggests that the
majority of parasites may be floaters (i.e. non-nesters) in the
population or nesting in nearby natural cavities. We found no evidence
of host selection based on host age, arrival at the breeding site, or
nest-box productivity in the previous year. This opportunistic behavior
is likely facilitated by the nesting ecology of this population, in that
nest sites are limited, conspicuous, and relatively dense. Future
studies investigating CBP in populations using natural cavities can help
elucidate the drivers of this behavior.},
