Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of
   which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and
   pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity
   can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and
   decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old
   (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed
   reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and
   restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br.
   (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and
   graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five
   remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using
   microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were
   assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination
   graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations
   had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations
   (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between
   restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other
   pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01;
   n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity
   (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances
   (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate
   reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of
   B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance
   pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates
   their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent
   to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.}},
