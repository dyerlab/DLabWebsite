 abstract = {Reticulitermes termites play key roles in dead wood decomposition and
nutrient cycling in forests. They also damage man-made structures,
resulting in considerable economic loss. In the eastern United States,
five species (R. flavipes, R. virginicus, R. nelsonae, R. hageni and R.
malletei) have overlapping ranges and are difficult to distinguish
morphologically. Here we present a molecular tool for species
identification. It is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification of a section of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
subunit II gene, followed by a three-enzyme restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) assay, with banding patterns resolved via agarose
gel electrophoresis. The assay was designed using a large set of
training data obtained from a public DNA sequence database, then
evaluated using an independent test panel of Reticulitermes from the
Southern Appalachian Mountains, for which species assignments were
determined via phylogenetic comparison to reference sequences. After
refining the interpretive framework, the PCR-RFLP assay was shown to
provide accurate identification of four co-occurring species (the fifth
species, R. hageni, was absent from the test panel, so accuracy cannot
yet be extended to training data). The assay is cost- and
time-efficient, and will help improve knowledge of Reticulitermes
species distributions.},
