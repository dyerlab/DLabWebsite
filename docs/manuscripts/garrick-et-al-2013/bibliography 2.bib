 abstract = {Ecologically interacting species may have phylogeographical histories
that are shaped both by features of their abiotic landscape and by
biotic constraints imposed by their coassociation. The Baja California
peninsula provides an excellent opportunity to examine the influence of
abiotic vs. biotic factors on patterns of diversity in plant-insect
species. This is because past climatic and geological changes impacted
the genetic structure of plants quite differently to that of
codistributed free-living animals (e.g. herpetofauna and small mammals).
Thus, plant-like' patterns should be discernible in host-specific insect
herbivores. Here, we investigate the population history of a monophagous
bark beetle, Araptus attenuatus, and consider drivers of
phylogeographical patterns in the light of previous work on its host
plant, Euphorbia lomelii. Using a combination of phylogenetic,
coalescent-simulation-based and exploratory analyses of mitochondrial
DNA sequences and nuclear genotypic data, we found that the evolutionary
history of A.attenuatus exhibits similarities to its host plant that are
attributable to both biotic and abiotic processes. Southward range
expansion and recent colonization of continental Sonora from the Baja
peninsula appear to be unique to this taxon pair and probably reflect
influences of the host plant. On the other hand, abiotic factors with
landscape-level influences on a diverse suite of codistributed
arid-adapted taxa, such as Plio- and Pleistocene-aged marine incursions
in the region, also left genetic signatures in beetle and host plant
populations. Superimposed on these similarities, bark beetle-specific
patterns and processes were also evident: our data revealed two
secondarily sympatric, reproductively isolated genetic lineages, as well
as a previously unrecognized mid-peninsular warm desert refuge. Taken
together, this work illustrates that the evolutionary history of
species-specific insect herbivores may represent a mosaic of influences,
includingbut not limited tothose imposed by the host plant.},
