I had played around a bit with John Sundell’s excellent Publish but there are just too many things I do in R that would increase the difficulty in deploying outside of RMarkdown.\nWithout further ado, here it is. I am going to try to bring over older posts if I can figure out how to do that and I’ll be documenting it all here for those of you who are moving from hugo to distill.\n\n\n\n",
