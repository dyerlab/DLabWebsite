## Version 1.6.0

The fixes in this latest version include:  

- [REQ] Test for HWP and LD similar to that implemented in Genepop? I work with microsatellite loci that have many rare alleles, so a HWP/LD test with a MC algorithm similar to that used in Genepop would be ideal  

- [ADD] Added heirfstat to `genetic_structure()` to allow functional calling  

- [ADD] Added hooks into genetic distances from pegas through `genetic_distance()` for other distance measures.  

- [FIX] stratum He/Ho genetic_diversity `Hs()`

- [FIX] Add permutation to `Fst()` for significance

- [FIX] `pies_on_map` apparently is broken

- [FIX] Problem with having a missing genotype for `type="column"` in first row.  Odd problem.

- [ADD] Feedback for reading in columns for `read_population()` when > 500 loci to provide some level of feedback to the user showing it is doing something and not just sitting there.

- [ADD] Added `Hi()` (individual heterozygosity) function.

- [FIX] Change 'locus' to 'loci' in `frequency_matrix()` to be consistent with the frequencies() function argument list.

- [FIX] Catching problem where empty (instead of `NA`) data was causing `locus(.,type="separated")` to fail.
