Today I will be working on explaining how to use basic markdown to the Data Literacy class. This is a critical component of understanding basic data literacy as it is a foundation for reproducible research.

This year I am using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) as a main teaching tool and each of the componetns of the class are being represented as their own individual repository. For this topic, I have two different repositories.

  - [Quarto](https://github.com/DyerlabTeaching/Quarto) the document processing system
  - [Markdown](https://github.com/DyerlabTeaching/Markdown) syntax

The basic format of these repositories contains basic learning objectives, content in the form of slide sets and a larger narrative document, external resources, etc.

We shall see how this goes.
