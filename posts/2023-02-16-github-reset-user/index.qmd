  There are times when you need to have multiple different repository accounts for github and moving between them can be a bit of a problem.  Here is my solution.

```{r}
#| echo: false
```

So I was working on a repository at home that I set up on another github acount, for another entity.  In doing so, I clobbered my `global` github `user` and `user.email` values and as such when I tried to `git push` none of the changes would go because it could not authenticate.  Instead I got this:

```{bash}
rodney$ git push
remote: Permission to dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git denied to windbunny.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

So, what you have to do is reconfigure the `username`, `user.email`, and `remote.origin.url` to reset your user name for ssh/https pushing.

```{bash}
rodney$ git config user.name dyerlab
rodney$ git config user.email rjdyer@vcu.edu
rodney$ git config remote.origin.url https://dyerlab@github.com/dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git
```

Then the next time you `push` it (go Salt-n-Pepper), it will ask for your authentication token again.  Enter it and you are good.
