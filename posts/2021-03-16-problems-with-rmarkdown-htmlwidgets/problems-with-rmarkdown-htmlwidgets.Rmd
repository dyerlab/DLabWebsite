OK, so in working on various RMarkdown stuff, Iâ€˜ve just run across a problem with it no longer rendering HTMLWidget stuff in the recent upgrade.  So if you use something like `mermaid` or `leaflet` in your `xaringan` presentation, it will show you the raw

```html
<div></div>
```

output instead of the actual widget.   This is not an easy one to track down online because the [RMarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) & [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) Github sites do not address it.  So I thought I would insert a thing here so I can find it next time I need it.

As it turns out, we need to set an option in the setup chunck as follows:

```r
options(htmltools.preserve.raw = FALSE)
```

This will fix things until RStudio fixes the markdown problems and the world can get back to normal.
