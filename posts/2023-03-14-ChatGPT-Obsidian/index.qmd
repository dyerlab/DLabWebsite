  After a really interesting conversation with a colleague of mine here at work, I thought I'd step beyond using mem.ai and tana+chatgpt to develop a quick tutorial of how you may like to index a local text repository, in this case my Obsidian Notes directory, using the most recent OpenAI build and not have to get into the weeds using R and lexers, etc.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
library(stringr)
```


So for this we are going to use their `python` interface.


```
rodney@Rodneys-Mac-Studio ~ % python3 --version 
Python 3.11.2
```

```
rodney@Rodneys-Mac-Studio ~ % pip3 --version   
pip 22.3.1 from /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pip (python 3.11)
```
