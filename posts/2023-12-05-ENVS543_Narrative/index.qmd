## Data Literacy

![](featured.gif)


By far, the most important set of skills for data analysis is the abiltiy to easily get, manipulate, translate, summarize, and visualize raw data.  In the end, it is always a very trivial thing to run the analysis, which is often just a few function calls.  What takes the most time is taking the data that was given to you, figuring out why the person who gave you the data *hates* you and your free time, and how to reform it into something usable.  That is what this course is about.
