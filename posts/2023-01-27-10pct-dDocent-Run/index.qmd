  A bit optimistic here but I thought I'd run an assembly with 10% of the data from each individual and see how many configs I could produce.  It did run and produced 394,146 contigs from 969,927 sequences.  But unfortunately, it was running on all the data to map at 10% and was going to take just too long.  So I killed it.

So this time I made a small representation of the overall sequences, using: 
- 10% of each individual 
- Renamed to not have period in population name for each state (thinking that may be why I've had failures in the past).
- Saved to different folder.

```
rm(list=ls())

files <- list.files("all",pattern="F.fq.gz")
for( i in 1:length(files) ) {
	file <- files[i]
	tmp <- strsplit(file, split="\\.")[[1]]
	ofile <- paste( paste( tmp[1],
								 tmp[2],
								 sep=""), 
						tmp[3], tmp[4], tmp[5], sep=".")
	cmd <- paste("seqtk sample ./all/",
					 file,
					 " 0.10 | gzip > ./all010/", 
					 ofile, 
					 sep="")
	system(cmd)
	cat( format(i/length(files), digits=3), " ", ofile, "\n")
}
```

It ran for a while, then died.  So I tried it again and there were some issues with dDocent not recognizing the the files as being `gz` files...  So I had to unzip all the 10% individuals and redo them.

Finally it went through but I got a few errors along the way.

```
Trimming reads and simultaneously assembling reference sequences

Removing the _1 character and replacing with /1 in the name of every sequence
parallel: Warning: Starting 16 processes took > 2 sec.
parallel: Warning: Consider adjusting -j. Press CTRL-C to stop.
```

Then it gave me the prompt for number of unique sequences per individual.

```r  
Please choose data cutoff. In essence, you are picking a minimum (within individual) coverage level for a read (allele) to be used in the reference assembly.

I had hit the return button a few times and it ran using some 'default' value.


This time it did finish and made contigs.

```
At this point, all configuration information has been entered and dDocent may take several hours to run.

It is recommended that you move this script to a background operation and disable terminal input and output.

All data and logfiles will still be recorded.
To do this:
Press **control** and **Z** simultaneously
Type **bg** and press enter
Type **disown -h** and press enter
Now sit back, relax, and wait for your analysis to finish

dDocent assembled 969927 sequences (after cutoffs) into 394146 contigs

```


So at this point, I let it run for a while longer and then realized I was not going to use the 10% representation and would be using another assembly.  So I killed the mapping.
