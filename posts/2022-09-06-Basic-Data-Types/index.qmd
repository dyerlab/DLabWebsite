So today, we started the work on [Basic Data Types](https://github.com/DyerlabTeaching/Basic-Data-Types) in R. I am looking at simplifying things a bit and just starting with a working knowledge of some of the most common data types we use, including:

-   Missing data `NA`

-   Numeric data

-   Character data

-   Logical data

-   Dates & Time

The homework for this activity will focus on use of variable creation, data assignment, coercion, introspection, and some simple operations on the each of the data types.
