It is good to remember that the vast majority of what you'll be working with is actually stuff you are going to throw away in the end anyways. That being said, our first main tool will be `screen`. This is a program that allows you to create a \"sub shell\" for a process, do something that is going to take a long time, log out of the shell and continue on your daily routine. Then, at various times in the near (or distant) future, you can log back in and see how things are going.\n",
