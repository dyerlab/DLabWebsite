title: "Population Graphs on Vision Pro"
description: |
  Just got the Apple Vision Pro and started working on laying out using RealityKit.  It is a bit different than SceneKit, but both better and more integrated with the features that I've come to love about modern Swift + SwiftUI development.  I'm very excited.

First `proof of concept` for [Population Graphs](https://dyerlab.org/manuscripts/dyer-nason-2004/) estimation and construction using Augmented Reality on the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/).

I've very impressed, given that it has been just a few hours to make the transition from SceneKit legacy knowledge to jump right into RealityKit.  This is going to be great.
