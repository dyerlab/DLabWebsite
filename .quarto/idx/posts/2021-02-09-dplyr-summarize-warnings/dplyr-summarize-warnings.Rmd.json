You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n\nBut why would I want to 'override' that grouping dplyr::authors?  Didn't I **just set the grouping**?  I would suspect that the majority of use cases are exactly like above (`group_by()` immediately by `summarize()`).  \n\nWhile much of `tidyverse` is too verbose for most of my liking.  I can do without messages like:\n\n![messages on tidyverse startup](featured.png)\n\nWell I finally figured out how to shut the first part up (still working on the second part). \nJust put the following code into your `.Rprofile` file for a global fix, or any code you are using on a per-file basis.\n\n```\noptions( dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE )\n```\n\nNow if we could just find some way to not have to use `include=FALSE` in the chunk preamble or `suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))` just to load in a library without adding a bunch of crap to our markdown files.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"dplyr-summarize-warnings.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"dplyr summarize Warnings","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2021-02-09","image":"featured.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
