When you purchase new primers, you need to aliquot out usable volumes because repeated freeze/thaw cycles reduce RE efficiency.  Here are some guidelines:\n\n  1. Order from NEB (<http://neb.com>), they are the shiznit (n.b., that is a technical term).\n  2. Do not order the MOST CONCENTRATED  but be reasonable.  We typically do not work in the volume of needing 100,000 U/ml, be reasonable.\n  3. When you receive the shipment from NEB, aliquot and dilute such that we get 5 U in 20µl putting in 2µl stock (e.g., shoot for 2.5 U/µl).\n  4. Template DNA should be no more than 300 ng.  We DO NOT need a lot of template to start with.\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"restriction-enzymes-for-aflps.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Restriction Enzymes for AFLPs","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2013-02-01"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
