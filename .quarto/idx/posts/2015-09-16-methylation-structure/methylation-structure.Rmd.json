We looked at methylation variation, localized within the genome and compared the amount of among-population variation present.  The underlying idea here is that in insects, methylation is more often encountered in coding regions, and has been shown in many cases to be influencing phenotype.\n\n<!--more-->So, the questions we are looking at are:\n\n  1. Is there spatial genetic variation in the methylation &#8216;loci'?  If not, methylation may not be useful in the search for adaptive variance.\n  2. If there is variation, does it mimic the spatial structure found in nucleotide-based markers? \n      * If some fraction of methylation loci, say _p_, do contain spatial structure then it means that these methylation patterns are inherited and can be used to help reconstruct neutral history.\n      * The rest of the methylation structure, say _1-p_, can be considered as being due to processes that operate at a time scale that does not capture recent demographic processes.  These would be the ones we are most interested in looking at for evidence of local adaptation, right?\n\nSo in the first step, how is the variation distributed amongst populations in the nucleotide markers and their paired methylation markers can be seen below.<figure id=\"attachment_659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-659\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-659 size-full\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PairedLocusStructure.png\" alt=\"PairedLocusStructure\" width=\"760\" height=\"757\" srcset=\"wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PairedLocusStructure.png 760w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PairedLocusStructure-150x150.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PairedLocusStructure-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /> <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Paired population structure for nucleotide, MSP, and methylation, HPA, loci.</figcaption></figure> \n\nIf we look at genetic distances between population for both sets of markers, we see a discongruence in the topological structure.
