On MacOS, make sure you have Homebrew installed and then follow those instructions.  \n\nFor me, it took a few additional steps because I was installing it on a new mac mini (in the home office).  I had not made sure everything was up-to-date before starting so I had to walk away for a little bit to let it all happen.  No biggie.\n\n```\nrodney@rodneys-mini ~ % brew install postgis\nError: The following formulae\n  [#<Dependency: \"python\" []>, #<Options: []>] and [#<Dependency: \"gcc\" []>, #<Options: []>]\ncannot be installed as binary packages and must be built from source.\nInstall the Command Line Tools:\n  xcode-select --install\n```\n\nSo I ran this to install the command line build tools:\n\n```\nrodney@rodneys-mini ~ % xcode-select --install\nxcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools\n```\n\nThis took several minutes as I had not updated my XCode in a while.  No problem though.  Then I went back and ran the command again, which installed a ton of dependencies.\n\n```\nrodney@rodneys-mini ~ % brew install postgis  \n==> Installing dependencies for postgis: cfitsio, popt, epsilon, expat, freexl, gdbm, openssl@1.1, readline, sqlite, xz, python, geos, giflib, gmp, isl, mpfr, libmpc, gcc, szip, hdf5, jpeg, jasper, json-c, libxml2, libdap, libtiff, proj, libgeotiff, libpng, libpq, libspatialite, netcdf, openblas, numpy, pcre, freetype, fontconfig, libffi, glib, lzo, pixman, cairo, little-cms2, nspr, nss, openjpeg, qt, poppler, libtool, unixodbc, webp, xerces-c, zstd, gdal, icu4c, krb5, postgresql, protobuf, protobuf-c, boost, eigen, cgal and sfcgal\n```\n\nThat took a while.\n\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"setting-up-postgresql-on-mac.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Setting up Postgresql on mac","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2020-03-12"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
