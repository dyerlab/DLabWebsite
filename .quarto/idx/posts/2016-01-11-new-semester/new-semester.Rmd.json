Here is a quick synopsis.\n\n  * Teaching _Population Genetics_, should be a ton of fun.\n  * Teaching the Distributed graduate seminar _Landscape Genetics_ again.\n  * Starting a new eDNA project with VDOT and getting a new student associated with it.\n  * Starting a new RadSEQ project on Protonotary Warblers and getting a new student to start in the fall.\n  * Starting a new Landscape Genetics NSF-funded project on gypsy moths with the Johnson Lab.  Need a technician for this one as well.\n  * The text _Applied Population Genetics_ should be released as an ebook.\n  * Should be finishing up both Jameson’s and Chitra’s theses and submitting them for publication.\n  * Moving into a new laboratory location and perhaps collapsing both our lab and the Verrelli lab into a single unit.\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"new-semester.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"New Semester","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2016-01-11"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
