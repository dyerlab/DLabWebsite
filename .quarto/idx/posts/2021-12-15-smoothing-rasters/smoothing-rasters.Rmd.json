Here is the area surrounding Loreto, BCS Mexico as represented by a 1-km resolution raster of elevation.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary( raster )\nurl <- \"https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/alt_22.tif\"\nraster( url ) %>%\n  crop(extent( -111.6, -111, 25.6, 26.2) ) -> baja_california\nplot( baja_california ) \n```\n\n\nFor simple viewing, we can tell the plot to interpolate it, which will shape it a bit.  This does not change the data, it only shows the data a bit differently.\n\n```{r}\nplot( baja_california, interpolate = TRUE )\n```\n\nWe can also resample the data, which changes it.  We can `disaggregate` it, which makes a new raster with a more fine grain resolution and interpolates the new values to fit.\n\n```{r}\nloreto_disaggregated <- disaggregate( baja_california, \n                                      fact = 5,\n                                      method = \"bilinear\")\n```\n\nwhich takes the previous raster whose size was:\n\n```{r}\ndim( baja_california )\n```\n\nand makes the new one of size\n\n```{r}\ndim( loreto_disaggregated )\n```\n\nas the `fact=5` means that each cell in `baja_california` is turned into a 5x5 set of cells whose values are interpolated.  Notice in the plot below, how the pixelation is reduced around the coast (this raster has all water = `NA`).\n\n```{r}\nplot( loreto_disaggregated )\n```\n\n\nWe can also smooth it using a custom focal operation based upon a matrix of values and a function we define for it.  Here the weight (`w`) matrix is a 5x5 matrix of 1 (defining the values around each spot that will be used) and the `fun=mean` will take the average of the 5x5 matrix of values.\n\n```{r}\nloreto_focal <- focal( baja_california, \n                       w = matrix(1, 5, 5), \n                       fun = mean, \n                       na.rm=TRUE)\n```\n\nThis approach *does not* change the resoution of each cell, it only smooths it out.  I also ignored `NA` for those edge cases.\n\n```{r}\ndim( loreto_focal )\n```\n\nAnd if you look at it, it still has some pixelation (minecraft-i-ness if you will)\n\n```{r}\nplot( loreto_focal )\n```\n\nThe method you choose is up to you and the consequences of changing the raw data.  Be careful.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"smoothing-rasters.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Smoothing rasters","description":"Sometimes it is helpful for visualization purposes (or when making a nice graphic), to smooth out a raster image.
