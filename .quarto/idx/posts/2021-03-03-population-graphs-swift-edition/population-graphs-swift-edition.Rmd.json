The long-term goals here are to leverage the upcoming advances in Augmented Reality and LiDAR at the phone/glasses level that I suspect will be more mainstream by 2023 or so.\n\n\nSo, in the long run, I’m looking to have a set of software that can do the following:\n\n- Estimate a population graph from genotype data.\n   - [ ] Write custom SVD routines linked with [Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate).\n   - [ ] Wrap in [GeneticStudio](craftdocs://open?blockId=D1B89492-9912-42FC-A789-D957E1FEF4C9&spaceId=07b940d2-163d-ebd5-c7c7-647f9d1cfbd1) interface for Genotype & Project CRUD.\n- Visualize the graph in either 2D ([SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/)), 3D ([SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/)), or in AR ([ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit)).\n   - [ ] Force directed estimation of location in 2-space\n   - [ ] Expand to 3-space\n   - [ ] Develop individual physics models for dynamical system in SpriteKit & SceneKit\n- Comprehensive set of network-based analytical output for local (node- and edge- centric) as well as global parameters.\n- Overlay spatial network on GeoTiff for prevalence/avoidance of features.\n- Chromosome walking - Use engine to analyze how population covariance changes along stretches of chromosomes from SNP-like data.\n- Population Simulation - Develop stochastic simulation background that is visualized using dynamical population graphs for hypothesis testing, where we specify a model and\n\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"population-graphs-swift-edition.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Population Graphs Swift Edition","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2021-03-03","preview":"featured.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
