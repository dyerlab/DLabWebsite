Why do these two have to be SOOOO much of a pain?  Why can't we have a auto build of a binary with all the options in it for OSX?  Who knows?  I always feel like I get the fuzzy end of the lollipop with these two.  Here is my latest approach for getting them going.\n\n<!--more-->First you have to make sure you have the latest GDAL libraries.  I used to get mine from \n\n[Kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks), just download the framework, install it, and then do some kind of long <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">R CMD INSTALL</span>  dance, which seems to no longer work for me.  I also tried installing from Ripley's repository and found that (a) It was a version older than the one I already had on my machine, and (b) you can't install from that repository , there is a malformed header and the <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">install.packages()</span>  function just barfs.\n\nTime to try something new.  I typically stay away from the various installer frameworks out there on OSX to keep everything in Frameworks.  But this time, I used MacPorts.  You can find the latest version [here](http://www.macports.org/).  Here is how I got it to help me out.\n\n  1. Downloaded the version for my OS, I'm currently on 10.10 and installed it.\n  2. In the terminal, I updated it <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline\">sudo port -v selfupdate</span>\n  3. I then used it to install gdal as a unix library (rather than as a framework so it won't be located in /Library/Frameworks) by <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">sudo port install gdal</span>.  There were **a lot** of dependencies for this one so it took a while.\n  4. I then had R install rgdal as <span class=\"lang:default decode:true crayon-inline \">install.packages( rgdal, type=&#8221;source&#8221;)</span>\n  5. Worked like a charm.\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"compiling-rgdal-on-osx-8211-why-do-you-hate-me.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Compiling RGDAL on OSX 8211 Why do you hate me","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2015-08-27"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
