You can also find them on github.  When I develop libraries for R, I typically develop them on <http://github.com/dyerlab> and then upload them to CRAN when I get to major milestones.  The latest versions of all my software will always be found on github.  So here is how to install packages directly.<!--more-->\n\nTo install from github directly, you need two things, the devtools library and the repository and project name on github that you'll be installing from.  As always, it is a great idea to update everything (latest version of R and packages via `update.packages(ask=FALSE)`) before you start.\n\n  1. In R, type `install.packages(\"devtools\")` and it will go grab the stuff for you.  If you are on a machine that does not have compilers and other developers tools on it, R will tell you to go download the RTools package and install it.  They give you a URL to follow and a function to test the installation with.  Use it.\n  2. `require(devtools)`\n  3. Assuming you are using my account (dyerlab) and installing the gstudio package, you would then type: `install_github(\"dyerlab/gstudio\")`.\n  4. Done.\n \n \n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"installing-r-packages-from-github.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Installing R packages from github","description":"A short description of the post.\n","author":[{"name":"Rodney Dyer","url":"https://dyerlab.org","affiliation":"Center for Environmental Studies","affiliation_url":"https://ces.vcu.edu","orcid_id":"0000-0003-4707-3453"}],"date":"2015-07-30"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
