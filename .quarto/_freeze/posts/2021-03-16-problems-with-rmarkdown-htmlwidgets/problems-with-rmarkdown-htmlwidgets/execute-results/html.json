So if you use something like `mermaid` or `leaflet` in your `xaringan` presentation, it will show you the raw\n\n```html\n<div></div>\n```\n\noutput instead of the actual widget.   This is not an easy one to track down online because the [RMarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) & [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) Github sites do not address it.  So I thought I would insert a thing here so I can find it next time I need it.\n\nAs it turns out, we need to set an option in the setup chunck as follows:\n\n```r\noptions(htmltools.preserve.raw = FALSE)\n```\n\nThis will fix things until RStudio fixes the markdown problems and the world can get back to normal.\n \n \n \n",
