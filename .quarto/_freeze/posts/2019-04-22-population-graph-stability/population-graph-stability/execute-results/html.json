In this context, it is often of interest to know the statistical stability of your loci in determining the topology you see in the popgraph.  Here is a way to subsample the loci you have and identify the extent to which you are asymptotically estimating a stable topology.  Basically we are going to:  \n1. Sample a subset of your loci randomly (without replacement) of a particular size (e.g., 10 loci).  \n2. Estimate a topology.  \n3. Measure some characteristic (or characteristics) on that topology.  \n4. GoTo #1 a large number of times (say 100).  \n5. Increment the number of loci being used.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n",
