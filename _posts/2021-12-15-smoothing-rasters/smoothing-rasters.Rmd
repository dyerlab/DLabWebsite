title: "Smoothing rasters"
description: |
  Sometimes it is helpful for visualization purposes (or when making a nice graphic), to smooth out a raster image.  Here are some cheap and quick methods.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library( raster )
library( magrittr )
```

So let's load in a raster and crop it down to look at it.  Here is the area surrounding Loreto, BCS Mexico as represented by a 1-km resolution raster of elevation.

```{r}
library( raster )
url <- "https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/raw/master/data/alt_22.tif"
raster( url ) %>%
  crop(extent( -111.6, -111, 25.6, 26.2) ) -> baja_california
plot( baja_california ) 
```


For simple viewing, we can tell the plot to interpolate it, which will shape it a bit.  This does not change the data, it only shows the data a bit differently.

```{r}
plot( baja_california, interpolate = TRUE )
```

We can also resample the data, which changes it.  We can `disaggregate` it, which makes a new raster with a more fine grain resolution and interpolates the new values to fit.

```{r}
loreto_disaggregated <- disaggregate( baja_california, 
                                      fact = 5,
                                      method = "bilinear")
```

which takes the previous raster whose size was:

```{r}
dim( baja_california )
```

and makes the new one of size

```{r}
dim( loreto_disaggregated )
```

as the `fact=5` means that each cell in `baja_california` is turned into a 5x5 set of cells whose values are interpolated.  Notice in the plot below, how the pixelation is reduced around the coast (this raster has all water = `NA`).

```{r}
plot( loreto_disaggregated )
```


We can also smooth it using a custom focal operation based upon a matrix of values and a function we define for it.  Here the weight (`w`) matrix is a 5x5 matrix of 1 (defining the values around each spot that will be used) and the `fun=mean` will take the average of the 5x5 matrix of values.

```{r}
loreto_focal <- focal( baja_california, 
                       w = matrix(1, 5, 5), 
                       fun = mean, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)
```

This approach *does not* change the resoution of each cell, it only smooths it out.  I also ignored `NA` for those edge cases.

```{r}
dim( loreto_focal )
```

And if you look at it, it still has some pixelation (minecraft-i-ness if you will)

```{r}
plot( loreto_focal )
```

The method you choose is up to you and the consequences of changing the raw data.  Be careful.
