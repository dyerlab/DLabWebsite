title: "Spring 2021 Landscape Genetics Workshop"
description: |
  This spring, my Landscape Genetics Workshop will need to be held virtually via zoom.  While that provides a set of unique challenges, it looks like this is facilitating a more diverse group of attendees, which is always beneficial. All course content is hosted on this site under Courses.

This spring, my Landscape Genetics Workshop will need to be held virtually via zoom.  While that provides a set of unique challenges, it looks like this is facilitating a more diverse group of attendees, which is always beneficial. All course content is hosted on this site under Courses [link](../../courses/landscapegenetics/).

Can't wait to start!
