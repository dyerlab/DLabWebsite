This spring, my Landscape Genetics Workshop will need to be held virtually via zoom.  While that provides a set of unique challenges, it looks like this is facilitating a more diverse group of attendees, which is always beneficial. All course content is hosted on this site under Courses [link](../../courses/landscapegenetics/).

Can't wait to start!
