So yesterday, Obsidian released (to beta testers) the first set of mobile apps (iOS/iPadOS/Android) for interacting with our vaults (if they are synced on iCloud or DropBox).  Really great bit of work, and Iâ€™m pretty excited to see how this thing is coming along.  

Here is a copy of my current *BrainForest*
