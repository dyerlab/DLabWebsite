<p>A population graph is a network structure based upon inter-stratum conditional genetic covariance (see <a href="/publication/dyer-nason-2004/index.html">Dyer &amp; Nason 2004</a> for a more complete discussion). In this context, it is often of interest to know the statistical stability of your loci in determining the topology you see in the popgraph. Here is a way to subsample the loci you have and identify the extent to which you are asymptotically estimating a stable topology. Basically we are going to:<br />
1. Sample a subset of your loci randomly (without replacement) of a particular size (e.g., 10 loci).<br />
2. Estimate a topology.<br />
3. Measure some characteristic (or characteristics) on that topology.<br />
4. GoTo #1 a large number of times (say 100).<br />
5. Increment the number of loci being used.</p>
