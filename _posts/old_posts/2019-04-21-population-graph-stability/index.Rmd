A population graph is a network structure based upon inter-stratum conditional genetic covariance (see [Dyer & Nason 2004](/publication/dyer-nason-2004/index.html) for a more complete discussion). In this context, it is often of interest to know the statistical stability of your loci in determining the topology you see in the popgraph.  Here is a way to subsample the loci you have and identify the extent to which you are asymptotically estimating a stable topology.  Basically we are going to:  
1. Sample a subset of your loci randomly (without replacement) of a particular size (e.g., 10 loci).  
2. Estimate a topology.  
3. Measure some characteristic (or characteristics) on that topology.  
4. GoTo #1 a large number of times (say 100).  
5. Increment the number of loci being used.
