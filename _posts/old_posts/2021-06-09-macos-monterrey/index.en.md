So yesterday, Apple introduced the next set of operating systems for iOS, MacOS, tvOS, iPadOS, and tvOS as well as a bunch of interesting upgrades for all the new hardware.  I took the plunge with installing it on my M1 Macbook and here are some thoughts on items as I see them evolve.

## Overall 

Overall, most things work out of the box with no problems.

- R, RStudio (minus git as described below)
- Mail - I wish they would add "send later" but works great and has more privacy functions.


## Safari

It is still REALLY FAST and new layout for the tabs.

## Development Tools


The first thing I did after install it was to install the latest version of [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), 13 beta.  It is a very large installation and I installed the optional development tools.

However, in `RStudio`, there was no `git` tab, so I knew there was a problem.

In the terminal, I verified there was an issue by trying to get the status of the same project folder.

```bash
rodney@Rodneys-M1 landscape-genetics-workshop % git status
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```

To fix it, I had to install some additional tools from the command line.

```bash
rodney@Rodneys-M1 landscape-genetics-workshop % xcode-select --install
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
```

Now it all works perfectly.
