I have accepted and begun working as the Director of the [Center for Environmental Studies](http://ces.vcu.edu) at [Virginia Commonwealth University](http://vcu.edu).  The Center is a chartered research center whose mission is to&#8230;  Well, do whatever I think it will do to produce the best research and educational opportunities for our undergraduate and graduate students.  We train applied scientists.

The Center has about 10 FTE faculty, a lot of which are shared among groups (e.g., half biology/half CES, half business/half CES, etc.) and several quality adjunct instructors.  We have about 250 undergraduates, 40 Masters-level graduate students in the program, and several individuals with Ph.D. students in the [Integrative Life Sciences](http://lifesciences.vcu.edu/academic-programs/phd-in-integrative-life-sciences/) program.
