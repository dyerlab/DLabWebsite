I just received the [program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0T81CzLjtfPTVA1MXp3ODh5aXc/view?usp=sharing) for an upcoming conference I'm presenting at in Paris on 23-24 September.  I'm really excited to see the other presenters and hear about their work on eco-design tools.  It is being held at la Gaîté Lyrique and sponsored by [ParisTech](http://www.paristech.fr/en/homepage) and the [Vinci Corporation](http://www.vinci.com/).
