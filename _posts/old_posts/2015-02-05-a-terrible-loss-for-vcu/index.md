This past week, VCU lost a champion of multidisciplinary research, Dr. Thomas Huff, Vice Provost of Life Sciences.  Tom was an unwavering advocate of interdisciplinary interactions and a continuous supporter of Biology.  He leaves lasting impressions on VCU, Life Sciences, and the Department of Biology.
