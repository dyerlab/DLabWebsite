  Welcome to the new format of the the Dyer Laboratory online website.  It was getting time to clean things up and streamline the ability to post materials online. So here it is, now in cleaner RMarkdown than before.

It is time to update the old blog and move platforms.  In the past, I had been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as my site generator but starting in 2022, I will now be working using [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill).  I had played around a bit with John Sundell's excellent [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) but there are just too many things I do in `R` that would increase the difficulty in deploying outside of RMarkdown.

Without further ado, here it is.  I am going to try to bring over older posts if I can figure out how to do that and I'll be documenting it all here for those of you who are moving from hugo to distill.
