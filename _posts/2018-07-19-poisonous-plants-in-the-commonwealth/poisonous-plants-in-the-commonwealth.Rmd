This past summer has seen some rather spectacular cases of where people have run afoul of dangerous flora, the most recent of which was a college student after a runin with [Giant Hogweed](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/health/2018/07/13/virginia-teen-suffered-third-degree-burns-giant-hogweed-plant/36841743/)&#8211;the results were not good.

## Information

The [Virginia Tech Cooperative Extension](https://ext.vt.edu/) group publishes a nice overview of toxic plants in the Commonwealth.  It has some useful information in that all of us should be aware of.
