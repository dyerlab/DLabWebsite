    "text": "The Swift Package Manager is a great tool to wrap up code and help compartmentalize some of your data. It is still evolving but is really powerful. I ran into a few issues when trying to figure out how to add image resources to a package.\nHere are the ways that I used to figure this out."

    "text": "Still Not Working\nOK, so this is still not working. I didnâ€™t get the error when compiling and testing on MacOS target, but I do when compiling for iOS. Apparetly, the best way to do it is to specify the items in the Resources directly explicitly.\nThe following does actually work!\n        .target(\n            name: \"DLab\",\n            dependencies: [],\n            resources: [\n                .copy(\"Resources/tree.png\")\n            ]\n        ),\nNow it does work. And if you need to have additional items, they need to go into their own .copy() framework."
