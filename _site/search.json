    "title": "Defining the landscape of adaptive genetic diversity",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nWhether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e. metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species. What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.)."

    "title": "Comparison of Pollination Graphs",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nFrom the agent-based, correlated random walk model presented, we observe theeffects of varying the maximum turning angle, δmax, tree density, ω, and pollen carryover, κmax, on the distribution of pollen within a tree population by examining pollination graphs. Varying maximum turning angle and pollen carryover alters the dispersal of pollen, which affects many measures of connectivity of the pollination graph. Among these measures the clustering coefficient of fathers is largest when δmax is between 60 and 90∘ . The greatest effect of varying ω is not on the clustering coefficient of fathers, but on the other measures of genetic diversity. In particular when comparing simulations with randomly placed trees with that of actual tree placement of C. florida at the VCU Rice Center, it is clear that having specific tree locations is crucial in determining the properties of a pollination graph."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree species. Because pollen movement influences the creation, maintenance and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations, it is important to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement. Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers. Extrinsic factors, such as the intervening vegetative structure and local pollen donor densities, can also influence the genetic composition of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers, we examined the structure and diversity of pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri, USA. Our analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands (approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen pool within regions (phi (SR) = 0.095), but not among regions (phi (RT) = 0.010), indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted. Furthermore, the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho = 0.32) provided support for the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen pool, measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each stand. However, pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with vegetative structure, measured as total forest tree density. Our findings indicated that on-going pollen movement within continuous forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by distance and vegetative structure."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHabitat fragmentation and landscape topology may influence the genetic structure and connectivity between natural populations. Six microsatellite loci were used to infer the population structure of 35 populations (N = 788) of the alpine Arabian burnet moth Reissita simonyi (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae) in Yemen and Oman. Due to the patchy distribution of larval food plants, R. simonyi is not continuously distributed throughout the studied area and the two recognized subspecies of this endemic species (Reissita s. simonyi/R. s. yemenicola) are apparently discretely distributed. All microsatellites showed prevalence of null alleles and therefore a thorough investigation of the impact of null alleles on different population genetic parameters (F-ST, inbreeding coefficients, and Population Graph topologies) is given. In general, null alleles reduced genetic covariance and independence of allele frequencies resulting in a more connected genetic topology in Population Graphs and an overestimation of pairwise F-ST values and inbreeding coefficients. Despite the presence of null alleles, Population Graphs also showed a much higher genetic connectivity within subspecies (and lower genetic differentiation (via F-ST)) than between; supporting existing taxonomic distinction. Partial Mantel tests showed that both geographical distance and altitude were highly correlated with the observed distribution of genetic structure within R. simonyi. In conclusion, we identified geographical and altitudinal distances in R. simonyi as well as an intervening desert area to be the main factors for spatial genetic structure in this species and show that the taxonomic division into two subspecies is confirmed by genetic analysis."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPatterns of pollen dispersal are central to both the ecology and evolution of plant populations. However, the mechanisms controlling either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process may be influenced by site-specific factors such as local forest structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here, we present an extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed 2Gener analysis of pollen pool structure. This model, dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA (StAMOVA), focuses on determining to what extent ecological, demographic, and/or environmental factors influence the observed genetic variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified for efficacy, using an extensive battery of simulations, illustrating: ( 1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation of spatially separated pollen pools, and ( 2) how effectively the Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections. Finally, the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set, from which we have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set, we show how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast these results with those derived from the original 2Gener analysis."

    "title": "Patterns of mating in an insect-pollinated tree species in the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system, which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In 1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as management treatments are continued and further studies on additional plant species."

The South African Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is the most diverse extratropical area for plant biodiversity, and much of its habitat is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. There has long been great interest in explaining the underlying factors driving this unique diversity, especially as much of the CFR is endangered by urbanization and other anthropogenic activity. Here, we use a population and landscape genetic analysis of SNP data from the CFR endemic plant Leucadendron salignum or “common sunshine conebush” as a model to address the evolutionary and environmental factors shaping the vast CFR diversity. We found that high population structure, along with relatively deeper and older genealogies, is characteristic of the southwestern CFR, whereas low population structure and more recent lineage coalescence depict the eastern CFR. Population network analyses show genetic connectivity is facilitated in areas of lower elevation and higher seasonal precipitation. These population genetic signatures corroborate CFR species-level patterns consistent with high Pleistocene biome stability and landscape heterogeneity in the southwest, but with coincident instability in the east. Finally, we also find evidence of human land-usage as a significant gene flow barrier, especially in severely threatened lowlands where genetic connectivity has been historically the highest. These results help identify areas where conservation plans can prioritize protecting high genetic diversity threatened by contemporary human activities within this unique cultural UNESCO site."

Traditionally, population geneticists have used methods such as F-statistics, pairwise isolation by distance models, spatial autocorrelation and coalescent models to analyse this variation and to gain insight about causal evolutionary processes. Here we introduce a novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework. This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic interactions among populations. We introduce the application of Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance, isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by discussing the applicability of Population Graphs for addressing a wide range of population genetic and phylogeographical problems."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) was first introduced to Massachusetts in 1869 and within 150 years has spread throughout eastern North America. This large‐scale invasion across a heterogeneous landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double digest restriction‐site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to discover genome‐wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude (FST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns. The populations most important for these signals were two range‐edge populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non‐native species to invade novel environments."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nGene flow in animals is limited or facilitated by different features within the landscape matrix they inhabit. The landscape representation in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also, desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents, generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface (NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity. Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs. categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami’s functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami’s behavior and physiology."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSex-specific genetic structure is a commonly observed pattern among vertebrate species. Facing differential selective pressures, individuals may adopt sex-specific life history traits that ultimately shape genetic variation among populations. Although differential dispersal dynamics are commonly detected in the literature, few studies have used genetic structure to investigate sex-specific functional connectivity. The recent use of graph theoretic approaches in landscape genetics has demonstrated network capacities to describe complex system behaviours where network topology represents genetic interaction among subunits. Here, we partition the overall genetic structure into sex-specific graphs, revealing different male and female dispersal dynamics of a fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) metapopulation in southern Ontario. Our analyses based on network topologies supported the hypothesis of male-biased dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of the landscape, identified at the population level, could be partitioned among sex-specific strata. We found that female connectivity was negatively correlated with snow depth, whereas connectivity among males was not. Our findings underscore the potential of conducting sex-specific analysis by identifying landscape elements or configuration that differentially promotes or impedes functional connectivity between sexes, revealing processes that may otherwise remain cryptic. We propose that the sex-specific graph approach would be applicable to other vagile species where differential sex-specific processes are expected to occur."

    "text": "Abstract\nMountains as natural barriers often have important effects on intraspecific genetic structure through restraining gene flow and enhancing differentiation among populations. While the Qinling and Daba mountains are considered significant geographic barriers, dividing China into temperate and subtropical regions, little is known about how this barrier influences the genetic patterns of sister species represented in distinct habitats. In this study, we analyzed genetic differentiation and the geographic boundary between Pinus henryi and Pinus tabuliformis using chloroplast microsatellite markers. Our data show high levels of among-population differentiation, consistent with the effects of historical demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and climate effects. Three main geographic boundaries coinciding with mountain systems indicate natural landscapes, such as large rivers, and habitat loss caused by anthropogenic deforestation, are significant barriers to genetic exchange among populations. The divergence between populations in the eastern and western Qinling Mountains populations may possibly be ascribed to fragmentation driven by climate change. The genetic boundary of P. henryi and P. tabuliformis generally coincides with the previous morphological dividing line based on the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages and on spatial analysis of molecular variance.

This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we believe forest trees offer an unparalleled opportunity to address fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic approaches that provide critical information needed for natural resource management. In this paper, we will cover four topics. First, we begin by defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation for tree species in the application of this approach toward understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic analyses. Finally, we briefly touch on how these approaches can aid in understanding practical topics such as management of tree populations facing climate change."

We examined 359 individuals from 23 populations over 370 km within the James River Basin of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin. Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However, surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead to better management strategies for control and eradication."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe recognition that communal roosts are important elements within the life cycle of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) led to their protection under the ``disturb″ clause of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The regular roost-switching movements of bald eagles imply that roosts are part of an interactive network where roosts represent nodes linked by birds moving between them. Network analysis holds promise for informing management decisions by assessing the effect of roost removal on the resilience of the broader network. We tracked nonbreeding bald eagles (n = 56) within the upper Chesapeake Bay (2008-2013), USA, to evaluate roost characteristics and network structure. We used midnight locations (n = 14,464) to assess the use of communal roosts (n = 212) and movement of birds among roosts (n = 2,634) on successive roost nights to evaluate the pattern and strength of connections. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the response of the roost network to roost loss. Structure of the roost network approximated that of a scale-free network where the distribution of connections follows a power law of the form P(k)=Ak(-gamma) and gamma = 1.1. Unlike random networks, connections within scale-free networks are concentrated within a few highly connected nodes (hubs). These hub roosts serve as bridges between large numbers of other roosts, have the shortest travel times to other roosts and greatest overall influence on network functioning. The effect of roost removal on overall network function was directly proportional to the connectivity of the roost being removed. The targeted removal of the majority (>90%) of roosts had very little effect on the network. Network sensitivity was high in response to the loss of roosts within the highest 10% of connectivity. This small (n = 18) subset of roosts makes a disproportionate contribution to network function and the protection of these roosts should be a stated management objective with high priority. Network analysis represents a powerful tool with the potential to inform management decisions. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society."

    "title": "Pollen-mediated gene dispersal within continuous and fragmented populations of a forest understorey species, Trillium cuneatum",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations, located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently developed 2Gener analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size (A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each population. We extended the 2Gener method by developing inference on the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66) and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects in Trillium habitats."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nLandscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward’s chord distance D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii, removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic analyses."

    "title": "Nuclear gene phylogeography using PHASE: dealing with unresolved genotypes, lost alleles, and systematic bias in parameter estimation",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses. Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e., a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic parameters. Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and effort is needed to overcome the observed biases."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAs urbanization drastically alters the natural landscape and generates novel habitats within cities, the potential for changes to gene flow for urban-dwelling species increases. The western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus) is a medically relevant urban adapter pest species, for which we have previously identified population genetic signatures consistent with urbanization facilitating gene flow, likely due to human-mediated transport. Here, in an analysis of 1.9 million genome-wide SNPs, we contrast broad-scale geographical analyses of 10 urban and 11 non-urban locales with fine-scale within-city analyses including 30 urban locales across the western USA. These hierarchical datasets enable us to test hypotheses of how urbanization impacts multiple urban cities and their genetic connectivity at different spatial scales. Coupled fine-scale and broad-scale analyses reveal contrasting patterns of high and low genetic differentiation among locales within cities as a result of low and high genetic connectivity, respectively, of these cities to the overall population network. We discuss these results as they challenge the use of cities as replicates of urban eco-evolution, and have implications for conservation and human health in a rapidly growing urban habitat."

    "text": "In plants, long-distance dispersal is both attenuated and directed by specific movement vectors, including animals, wind, and/or water. Hence, movement vectors partly shape metapopulation genetic patterns that are, however, also influenced by other life-history traits such as clonal growth. We studied the relationship between area, isolation, plant-species richness, reproduction, and dispersal mechanisms with genetic diversity and divergence in 4 widespread wetland plant-species in a total of 20 island-like kettle-hole habitats surrounded by an intensive agricultural landscape. Our results showed that genetic parameters reflect the reproduction strategies with the highest genetic diversity being observed in the non-clonal, outcrossing Oenanthe aquatica compared to the clonal Lycopus europaeus, Typha latifolia, and Phragmites australis. Lycopus showed a positive relationship between genetic diversity and kettle-hole area, but a negative relationship with the number of neighboring kettle holes (less isolation). Genetic diversity increased with plant-species richness in the clonal species Phragmites and Lycopus; while it decreased in the non-clonal Oenanthe. Finally, genetic divergence and, therefore, connectivity differed between alternative dispersal strategies, where wind-dispersed Typha and Phragmites had a higher gene flow between the analyzed kettle holes compared with the insect-pollinated, hydrochorous Lycopus and Oenanthe. Our study provides information on genetic patterns related to reproduction and dispersal mechanisms of 4 common wetland species contributing to the understanding of the functioning of plant metacommunities occurring in kettle holes embedded in agricultural landscapes."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHabitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean FST=0.01 +/- 0.01; N=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (rp=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix."

    "text": "Abstract\nUnderstanding migratory connectivity is essential for determining the drivers behind population dynamics and for implementing effective conservation strategies for migratory species. Genetic markers provide a means to describe migratory connectivity; however, they can be uninformative for species with weak population genetic structure, which has limited their application. Here, we demonstrated a genomic approach to describing migratory connectivity in the prothonotary warbler, Protonotaria citrea, a Neotropical songbird of conservation concern. Using 26,189 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we revealed regional genetic structure between the Mississippi River Valley and the Atlantic Seaboard with overall weak genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0.0055; 95% CI: 0.0051–0.0059). Genetic variation had a stronger association with geographic rather than environmental factors, with each explaining 14.5% and 8.2% of genetic variation, respectively. By varying the numbers of genomic markers used in population assignment models with individuals of known provenance, we identified a maximum assignment accuracy (89.7% to site, 94.3% to region) using a subset of 600 highly differentiated SNPs. We then assigned samples from nonbreeding sites to breeding region and found low migratory connectivity. Our results highlight the importance of filtering markers for informative loci in models of population assignment. Quantifying migratory connectivity for weakly structured species will be useful for expanding studies to a wider range of migratory species across taxonomic groups and may contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of migratory strategies."

As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, this study examined whether silvicultural practices influence pollen-mediated gene movement in the insect-pollinated species, Cornus florida L., by comparing pollen pool structure (Phi(st)) among clear-cutting, selective cutting, and uncut regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings - 10 each from 150 seed parents (43 in clear-cut, 74 in selective, and 33 in control sites) from six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha), eight allozyme loci were analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as 2Gener (Smouse et al., 2001; Evolution 55: 260-271). This analysis revealed that pollen pool structure was less in clear-cut ((Phi) over circle (C) = 0.090, P < 0.001) than in uncut areas ((Phi) over cap (U) = 0.174, P < 0.001), with selective-cut intermediate ((Phi) over circles = 0.125, P < 0.001). These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N(ep)) in clear-cut (N(ep) = 5.56) and selective-cut (N(ep) = 4.00) areas than in uncut areas (N(ep) = 2.87). We demonstrate that Phi(C) less than or equal to Phi(S) less than or equal to Phi(U), with (Phi) over circle (C), significantly smaller than (Phi) over circle (U) (P < 0.034). The findings imply that, as long as a sufficiently large number of seed parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic bottleneck in the effective number of mothers, silvicultural management may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents, and hence subsequent genetic diversity in Cornus florida."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe fragmented populations and reduced population densities that result from human disturbance are issues of growing importance in evolutionary and conservation biology. A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata ) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors (N (ep) ) and average distance of effective pollen movement (delta). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N (ep) = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance (delta) and estimated delta= 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which N (ep) may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N (ep) was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic isolation."

We describe the occurrence of CBP in a population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding in nest boxes, demonstrate associated fitness costs, and investigate parasite strategy. We genotyped individuals at 6 microsatellite loci and used Cervus software to determine log-likelihood of maternity (LOD scores) for offspring and social mothers. We set critical cutoff LOD scores at 95% confidence for exclusion of the social mother and assignment of a parasite mother from the breeding population. Of 805 nestlings (233 family groups during 2009-2013), we found that 12.7% had genotypes that were incompatible with their social mother. Females with unrelated nestlings (hosts) fledged fewer biological offspring within the host year than nonhost females despite fledging more total offspring, but being a host was not significantly associated with total reproductive success over 5 yr of breeding. We were able to identify only similar to 30% of parasite females, which suggests that the majority of parasites may be floaters (i.e. non-nesters) in the population or nesting in nearby natural cavities. We found no evidence of host selection based on host age, arrival at the breeding site, or nest-box productivity in the previous year. This opportunistic behavior is likely facilitated by the nesting ecology of this population, in that nest sites are limited, conspicuous, and relatively dense. Future studies investigating CBP in populations using natural cavities can help elucidate the drivers of this behavior."

In this study we experimentally excluded floral herbivores and predispersal seed predators (insecticide spray versus water control) over a 2-year period to examine the effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on levels of seed production, seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for Liatris cylindracea, an iteroparous perennial plant. In addition, we collected detailed demographic data on all life stage transitions for an additional set of individuals in the same population over 4 years. We used the experimental and demographic data to construct stochastic individual-based simulations to evaluate the overall effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on adult recruitment per maternal plant (a fitness component) and population growth rate. The insect exclusion experiments showed that damage due to insects decreased seed production, seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for both years’ experiments. These results indicate that recruitment was seed-limited through juvenile establishment, and that inflorescence-feeding insects influenced the degree of seed limitation. Results of the individual-based simulation models, which included individual demographic and temporal stochasticity, showed that inflorescence-feeding insects negatively affected the number of adult offspring per maternal plant recruited into the population and population growth rate for both years’ experiments. Taken together, the results of the experimental exclusions and the individual-based models indicate that inflorescence-feeding insects can influence population growth rate, and have the potential to act as a selective force for the evolution of traits in this plant species."

    "text": "Abstract\nGene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation (parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener) that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we describe the model’s elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling considerations. Second, we evaluate the model’s effectiveness by simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT), a male gametic analogue of Wright’s F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) = 0.06, translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m. Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about landscape-level gene movements."

They also damage man-made structures, resulting in considerable economic loss. In the eastern United States, five species (R. flavipes, R. virginicus, R. nelsonae, R. hageni and R. malletei) have overlapping ranges and are difficult to distinguish morphologically. Here we present a molecular tool for species identification. It is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a section of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene, followed by a three-enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay, with banding patterns resolved via agarose gel electrophoresis. The assay was designed using a large set of training data obtained from a public DNA sequence database, then evaluated using an independent test panel of Reticulitermes from the Southern Appalachian Mountains, for which species assignments were determined via phylogenetic comparison to reference sequences. After refining the interpretive framework, the PCR-RFLP assay was shown to provide accurate identification of four co-occurring species (the fifth species, R. hageni, was absent from the test panel, so accuracy cannot yet be extended to training data). The assay is cost- and time-efficient, and will help improve knowledge of Reticulitermes species distributions."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nUrban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health."

We examined the spatial genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae) adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small (s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) = 0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance. The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy), and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and quality of intervening canopy cover."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTo examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales. Two classes of complementary analytical approaches hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating were used to exploit phylogeographical signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago (Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c. 3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region, however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and geological changes even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape context."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcologically interacting species may have phylogeographical histories that are shaped both by features of their abiotic landscape and by biotic constraints imposed by their coassociation. The Baja California peninsula provides an excellent opportunity to examine the influence of abiotic vs. biotic factors on patterns of diversity in plant-insect species. This is because past climatic and geological changes impacted the genetic structure of plants quite differently to that of codistributed free-living animals (e.g. herpetofauna and small mammals). Thus, plant-like’ patterns should be discernible in host-specific insect herbivores. Here, we investigate the population history of a monophagous bark beetle, Araptus attenuatus, and consider drivers of phylogeographical patterns in the light of previous work on its host plant, Euphorbia lomelii. Using a combination of phylogenetic, coalescent-simulation-based and exploratory analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear genotypic data, we found that the evolutionary history of A.attenuatus exhibits similarities to its host plant that are attributable to both biotic and abiotic processes. Southward range expansion and recent colonization of continental Sonora from the Baja peninsula appear to be unique to this taxon pair and probably reflect influences of the host plant. On the other hand, abiotic factors with landscape-level influences on a diverse suite of codistributed arid-adapted taxa, such as Plio- and Pleistocene-aged marine incursions in the region, also left genetic signatures in beetle and host plant populations. Superimposed on these similarities, bark beetle-specific patterns and processes were also evident: our data revealed two secondarily sympatric, reproductively isolated genetic lineages, as well as a previously unrecognized mid-peninsular warm desert refuge. Taken together, this work illustrates that the evolutionary history of species-specific insect herbivores may represent a mosaic of influences, includingbut not limited tothose imposed by the host plant."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the effects of interindividual distance using spatial and increasingly ecological separation, yet have not incorporated individual plant characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site characteristics provided better models than those that only considered interindividual spatial distance (e.g. IBD). Models parameterized using conditional genetic covariance (e.g. population graphs) also outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better models describing gene flow than models including only between-site spatial (IBD) and ecological (isolation by resistance) variables. Overall, our results show that including interindividual and local ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level measures of contemporary gene flow."

    "text": "Logging In\nTo log into a machine you must use SSH. This is a secure shell and is encrypted on both ends so that others cannot snoop on your passwords or activities. If you are a windows person (shudder), you will have to use a GUI application to log into the server. Download one and install it. The server we will be using in this exercise is:\n\nchesapeake.envs.vcu.edu\nand can also be referenced by the raw IP address as:\n\n\n128.172.178.27\nBoth of these addresses are the same. You will need both a user name and password on the server before you can log into it.\nIf you are outside VCU network, you will have to log into our VPN (see vcu.edu and search for webvpn if you do not know how to do this). On a mac/unix/linux box, you can use the terminal application to log into the server as:\n\n\nssh chesapeake.envs.vcu.edu\nor with the raw IP address. Note: if you have a user name that is different on your local machine than it is on the server, you need to specify that in the ssh call as:\n\n\nssh server_user_id@chesapeake.envs.vcu.edu\nOnce you log into the remote server you will be greeted with a prompt from which you will be able to interact with the computer directly (e.g., no need for gui-pointy-clicky stuff).\n\n\n\nBash\nWhen you are logged into the server, you are actually working in an interactive programming environment. By default, the dyerlab servers run the Bash Shell. This is a command line interface that has the ability to do quite a few things that reduce the amount of tedium in your computational life. The entire philosophy of unix is to provide an environment where:\n\nThere is a strict partition between the stuff that you do in your own account and the stuff others do. Security at the OS level is priority number one and as such has a fairly strict set of requirements for what you as a user can see and do. This is good.\nThings work well together. Programs are small. There is no monolithic program that tries to do everything (except emacs but that is a flamewar of a different type). Programs do one type of task and do not try to multitask. This is very good because we have evolved an ecosystem of programs that are very efficient.\nIt is assumed that unix programs read and write text files, not binary files. It goes against the philosophy of the OS for a program to sequester its data into formats that are unreachable by other programs. If a program does this then it is no longer a citizen of the unix program community and as such has cut itself off from the breadth of opportunities that such an interaction entails. This is a very very good thing because you as a user can build complicated workflows in the environment that achieve things that would take much longer in the normal clickity-clickity mouse world we typically inhabit.\n\n\n\nBasic Commands\nTo move around a unix box on a server you are not in front of, you must do it from the command line. You will always be logged into your ‘home’ account. This is literally at the location in the file system /home/your_user_name. Everyone has their own home directory and you cannot see what is in other peoples home directories unless they do some rather severe hacks (violating #1 above). However, there are places you can put stuff to share materials between users, it is just not within the home directory. Here is an overview of some basic commands. You can always find out where you are by typing:\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npwd\n\n\nPrints out the current directory you are in.\n\n\n\n\nls\n\n\nLists the files and folders in that directory (see ls -l for a long listing)\n\n\n\n\ncd\n\n\nChange to your home directory\n\n\n\n\ncd ..\n\n\nChanges to directory that is the immediate parent of the current one\n\n\n\n\ncd folder\n\n\nChanges the directory to ‘folder’\n\n\n\n\nexit\n\n\nLogs you out of the computer\n\n\n\n\nchmod\n\n\nChanges the permission/privileges for files.\n\n\n\n\necho\n\n\nPrints out variables/content to the shell output\n\n\n\n\ncat\n\n\nConcatenates text to the terminal output\n\n\n\n\nhead\n\n\nPrints out the top lines of a file\n\n\n\n\nwc\n\n\nCounts words (default) or lines (-l) in a file\n\n\n\n\ngrep\n\n\nGets a regular expression (e.g., used for text searching)\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all programs (pwd, ls, cd, etc.) have a manual associated with them. This is because there are often many options to modify the behavior of the output. You can get to the manual for any program by:\n\nman prog\nAll manual entries have the same format and go through all the options available.\n\n\n\nEditing Files\nThere is a plethora of editors available to the unix user. Perhaps the easiest one on the servers you’ll be using is nano. This is a simple editor that allows you to open, change, and save text files. Given that this is a command-line environment, the menu-like options are available via keyboard combinations indicated at the bottom of the screen. In most unix environments the symbol ‘^’ denotes the control key (e.g., ^-Q would be holding down the control key and typing Q), and ‘M’ denotes the key labelled ‘alt’ (the modifier key). In nano these combinations act as the menu functionality.\nTo start an editing session type:\n\nnano\nand it will make a new file. If you have an existing file, you can edit it as:\n\n\nnano myfile.fasta\nfor example and it will open it up and start you on an editing session.\n\n\n\nPutting and Getting Files\nTo move documents from your computer to a remote server, we use the SSH Copy command ‘scp’. This is built into the ssh software itself.\n\nscp file remoteserver:~/\nThe last part, ‘:~/’ is required as it tells scp that the remoteserver is a server and you want the file to go into your home directory ‘~/’\n\n\nscp myremoteserver:~/thefile .\nThis will pull a file from the remote server to your current directory. Again notice that the period is there, a period in the options to a program specifically means ‘this place in the directory heirarchy.’\nIf you are using windows, there is a GUI drag and drop interface with your SSH client.\n\n\n\nRunning a Command Line Program\nOn a server all programs are run from the command line. You have already seen that you can run a program by typing its name and hitting return. The only reason this works is because there are executable binary files located in specific directories on the machine. These directories are all called ‘bin’ and they are located in parts of the folder heirarchy dictating who can access them. If you type at the command prompt:\n\necho $PATH\nit will return all the bin files that you are, by default, able to search for programs. The program echo prints out the value of a variable and all Bash Shell variables are indicated by a dollar sign (and by convention are typed in all upcase).\nIf a program is not in a ‘bin’ folder you access it will not run when you simply type its name. What you have to do is to tell the Bash Shell the location of the program specifically, even if it is in the same directory as you are.\nThere is one more requirement to execute a program. The program must be labelled as something that can be executed! In unix, scripts such as Bash Scripts, perl, python, lua, and many other languages can be used to make programs but these programs are just text files containing the instructions necessary to perform a task. To designate a program as a specific one that can be executed (if its contents actually can do something) you need to set the executable bit on the file by changing the mode of the file. This is done using chmod and telling it to add executable privileges.\n\n\nchmod +x program_file\nMany things have executable privileges, try a ls -l and look at the far left column to see the privileges, the last digit is either x or – indicating executable status or not (n.b., folders are executable, if you turn it off you will not be able to change directory into that folder).\n\n\n\nRedirecting Output\nAs mentioned above, programs are small and do specialized things but can work together in ways that are quite dynamic. This is done by redirecting output. Here are some examples. In the directory /usr/share/velvet_1.2.10/data, there are several example fasta files that come with velvet. Copy the test_reference.fa file to your directory as:\n\ncp /usr/share/velvet_1.2.10/data/test_reads.fa .\nYou should be able to see this file in your directory (via ls). Lets count how many lines are in that file. I see the following output (yours will be a bit different because you are not in my home directory (all the stuff to the left of the $ is not typed and is part of the bash prompt).\n\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ wc -l test_reads.fa\n\n\n285716 test_reads.fa\nSo this file has 285,716 lines in it. Lets now look at the first few lines:\n\n\n>SEQUENCE_0_length_35\n\n\nGGATATAGGGCCAACCCAACTCAACGGCCTGTCTT\n\n\n>SEQUENCE_1_length_35\n\n\nCGACGAATGACAGGTCACGAATTTGGCGGGGATTA\n\n\n>SEQUENCE_2_length_35\n\n\nCCAAATAGGTCCTTACATCATGAGACGGGCCAAAT\n\n\n>SEQUENCE_3_length_35\n\n\nCGAGATGTATACCTCTAACACTGTGTTCCAAGTAC\n\n\n>SEQUENCE_4_length_35\n\n\nAAGCTCCCGCAATGGATCTTGTGACGGGCTGCTCG\nThis output is dumped to the terminal. To redirect this output to another place, say a file, we use the redirect operator ‘>’ otherwise known as the greater than sign.\n\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ head test_reads.fa > firstfew.fa\n\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ wc -l firstfew.fa\n\n\n10 firstfew.fa\n\n\n\nPiping Between Programs\nHooking together programs is the next step and it is called piping. It is accomplished by hooking together the output of one program with the input of another using the pipe character ‘|’ (the vertical line on the slash key on US english keyboards). Lets say I wanted to search for a particular sequence in the test_reads.fa file. I’ll use GATACA because it was a good movie. I use the grep command to find it by passing first what I am looking for and then the file I am looking for it in. I will then pipe this through the wc program to see how many lines have that sequence of nucleotides within it.\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ grep GATACA test_reads.fa | wc -l\n\n\n790\nSo there are almost 800 reads with that sequence in it. We can continue to combine commands together beyond just these two. See if you can figure out what these commands do:\n\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ cat test_reads.fa | sort | head -100 > sortedfirstfew.fa\n\n\nrodney@chesapeake ~ $ head sortedfirstfew.fa\n\n\nAAAAAAAACGGGCTTATAGACCATGCAGGCTTCAT\n\n\nAAAAAAACACTATACAGCCAGAGTTCCTTCTTCTT\n\n\nAAAAAAACCCTTCTGTGTTTGATCTACCTACTATA\n\n\nAAAAAAACGGGCTTATAGACCATGCAGGCTTCATG\n\n\nAAAAAAACGTAAGGAGCGTTTATGCCAAACGAAGA\n\n\nAAAAAAAGGCTCGTGACTGTCATCATCGAGACGCC\n\n\nAAAAAAAGTGGGGTTCAAACACTCTATCCATGAAG\n\n\nAAAAAAATTGACTGTTAATGGCAATTTCAAGTTAT\n\n\nAAAAAACAGCGAACCAGATCTTATTTTGCTTCTAC\n\n\nAAAAAACATGACAACGAGAGCAACCCGGGCATTTG\n\n\n\nScreen\nOK, so when working on long-running programs, there is the need to be able to log in and out of a session without the various things you have running stopping each time. When you log into a unix machine, you start a ‘session’ and you can log in many times using the same user ID. When you log out, every process (running program) is purged from the memory and thus lost. So unless you plan on being logged into a terminal until a long running process is done running (some may take months), a better solution is needed. This is where a program called ‘screen’ comes in handy.\nScreen is a program that is run after you log into the server. What this does is to then make a ‘virtual session’ (or many of them) that you can attach and detach your terminal session to. You start screen by typing:\n\nscreen\nand then a read the verbage and continue (via space bar or hitting return). After that it will look like your normal terminal session and you’ll be able to do whatever you want to do just like before. Screen is running in the background\nSo lets say you start a long running process like:\n\n\n./VelvetOptimiser.pl -s 16 -e 31 -f “-short -raw ~/data/pedima/pedimaSNPs.fasta”\nThis can take a while to run. Now that you are already within a screen session, you can run it and then detach your terminal from that screen session. After you detach, the program will continue running just as before and you can re-attach at a later time to check on progress.\nHere are the commands for listing, attaching, and detaching from screen sessions (n.b., they all start with CTRL+a followed by another letter.\n\n\n\n\nKeys\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a c\n\n\nCreates a new shell window\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a k\n\n\nKills the current window\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a w\n\n\nLists all windows (the current session is marked with an ’*’)\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a d\n\n\nDetach from current session\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a D\n\n\nDetach from current session and close the shell as well\n\n\n\n\nCTRL+a 0-9\n\n\nGo to session 0, 1, … 9\n\n\n\n\nAfter you detach (CTRL+a d) you can exit the server and when you come back, you can reattach as:\n\n\nscreen -r\nif you only have one screen session going, otherwise you can just start screen, list the open sessions, and then come back at that time.\n\n\n\nVelvet\nLink to UMissouri\nhttp://umbc.rnet.missouri.edu/resources/How2RunVELVETonClark.html\nFrom NCBI: A basic protocol\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952100/"

Download and install it.\n\n\n\nInstallation\nHere is the general approach I used, that seemed to work.\n\nGrab the latest version of r-devel.It should be noted that there is currently no certificate for this, so you’ll have to believe that there is no malicious code in the bundle.\nsvn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ r-devel\nGrab the recommended packages that are not part of the r-devel distribution (you’ll need these or things will go pear shaped).\n./tools/rsync-recommended\nIf you are using OSX Mavericks, you may need to install the command line tools first (this only needs to be done once). Type this:\nxcode-select --install\nConfigure the compilation. I just grabbed these options from the default ones the binary OSX version uses.\n./configure 'CFLAGS=-mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'CXXFLAGS=-mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'OBJCFLAGS=-mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'FCFLAGS=-g -O2' 'F77FLAGS=-g -O2' '--with-system-zlib' '--enable-memory-profiling' '--disable-openmp' '--with-tcltk=/usr/local/lib' --with-x=no\nMake the base packages\nmake\nCheck the compilation for any potential errors.\nmake check\nMake the vignettes\nmake vignettes\nMake the manuals (an optional part here but if you are going to go through all this, you might as well do it completely). I compile them as PDF.\nmake pdf\nInstall it\n$ sudo make install\n\n\n\nUpdating\nOne of the benefits of having a svn repository locally is that you can just update it the next time that you need it and rebuild the components that have changed. To update the repository simply issue the following command in the directory with the r-devel folder.\nsvn up\nThen you can rebuild as outlined above."

    "text": "Spatial data often consists of very large datasets. One way to minimize the amount of computational resources you are going to use in R is to select only the spatial regions (extents) that you are working in and get rid of the remaining data. This is particularly important if you are going to be doing isolation modeling for genetic connectivity as the cost surface raster needs to be translated into a connectivity network. Data outside your area of interest are unnecessarily taking both resources and time away from your work.\nTo crop a raster, we need to identify the region we wish to keep as an extent object. An extent is a vector of length 4 defined as c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) describing the boundaries of are of interest.\nHere is an extent for the arapat data set.\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang:r decode:true\">require(gstudio)\ndata(arapat) lon.min <- min(arapat\\(Longitude) lon.max <- max(arapat\\)Longitude) lat.min <- min(arapat\\(Latitude) lat.max <- max(arapat\\)Latitude) e <- extent( lon.min, lon.max, lat.min, lat.max ) e ## class: Extent ## xmin: -114.2935 ## xmax: -109.1263 ## ymin: 23.0757 ## ymax: 29.32541\n\n<p>\n  This is the exact boundaries of the data set.

Here is an example of a basic matrix, whose values have been set to random normal variables (mean=0, sd=1) and then plot using the normal R plotting functions.\nx <- matrix(rnorm(100),ncol=10)\nimage(x)\n\n\nYou can see that despite the origin of a matrix when we write it (and when you work with the row and column indices in R on it) is different than when we plot it. Two things should be noted:\n\nThe axes from image() are not very helpful as they are scaled to the fractional width of the matrix rather than the number of rows and columns. This is apparently the preferred behavior from the people who wrote the original R graphics package.\nThe aspect ratio of the cells (e.g., each cell width and height) are not the same. This is problematic if we are intending these data to represent spatial content.\n\nThis matrix can be ‘decorated’ with additional attributes and turned into a raster object by casting it as one using the raster() function.\nrequire(raster)\nr <- raster( x )\nr\n## class : RasterLayer\n## dimensions : 10, 10, 100 (nrow, ncol, ncell)\n## resolution : 0.1, 0.1 (x, y)\n## extent : 0, 1, 0, 1 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## coord. ref. : NA\n## data source : in memory\n## names : layer\n## values : -2.612584, 2.403894 (min, max)\nIf we plot the raster object, we get a different view.\nplot(r)"

These would be the ones we are most interested in looking at for evidence of local adaptation, right?\n\n\nSo in the first step, how is the variation distributed amongst populations in the nucleotide markers and their paired methylation markers can be seen below.\n\n\n\nPaired population structure for nucleotide, MSP, and methylation, HPA, loci.\n\n\nIf we look at genetic distances between population for both sets of markers, we see a discongruence in the topological structure.

It is apparently ya single document bundle that contains two files:\n\nA info.json bundle\nA text.markdown text file.\n\nThere does not appear to be any tangible reason why a textBundle would be preferred over a single markdown file, so I’ll not consider it from here on.\n\n\nMarkdown\nYou can specify the flavor of markdown and the built-in types include Github. There is a nice interface here to select certain options on it and the ability to put it into a single markdown file.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2021-12-21 at 08.06.28.png\n\n\nOne of the other things that I didn’t quite appreciate was that for images, like the one inserted above,\n\n\n\nImage.png\n\n\nCraft will include an online reference to it on their craft servers. This does allow me to not have to upload everything to my flickr account, which is both nice (less steps) but troubling (what would happen if the craft servers go down or craft goes away (i no longer have all my stuff in one place). I suppose I could easily suck down all the images and relink them in the markdown if necessary. For now, I’ll call that a win.\n\n\n\nMarkdown 2 Distill\nFor this one, I think I’ll make a cheap and quick R solution to this. For that I’ll pick up in the next installment, and do it from the R side.\nFor this, I will enforce the following general rules.\n\nI’ll have to configure a featured image separate from this file (there is no opportunity for finding the location of the Cover Image at the top.).\nThe title will be moved form H1 to markdown metadata title.\nThe first paragraph will be taken and used as the description for the markdown metadata description.\nSave the raw markdown to a _toImport folder in the git repository for the site. The next time the site is built, it will convert the raw markdown into a distill::article object and inserted in the appropriate place.\n\nOnce I get it all up and running, then I can wrap it all up in a shortcut."

I’m going to use the stratum-level frequencies from the example data set.

This dataset will have 20 populations (I’ll just grab the first 20 Stratum from this frequency matrix).\n\nfreqs %>%\n  filter( Stratum %in% unique(freqs$Stratum)[1:20] ) -> sim_freqs\nsummary(sim_freqs)\n\n   Stratum             Locus              Allele            Frequency     \n Length:370         Length:370         Length:370         Min.   :0.0500  \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:0.1500  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :0.3500  \n                                                          Mean   :0.4297  \n                                                          3rd Qu.:0.7000  \n                                                          Max.   :1.0000  \n\n\nAnd we can take a quick look at the frequencies across populations for, say MP20 as:\n\nsim_freqs %>%\n  filter( Locus == \"MP20\", Stratum %in% unique(Stratum)[1:5] ) %>% \n  ggplot( aes(Allele,Frequency)) + \n  geom_bar( stat=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\" )  + \n  facet_grid( Stratum ~ .) + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nOK. Now, lets take a look at how we can make a random population. The make_population() function takes a frequency matrix and creates random individuals. Here is an example.\n\nfake101 <- make_population( sim_freqs %>% filter(Stratum==\"101\"), N=100 )\n\nWarning in make_loci(f, N, F): Your allele frequencies do not add to 1.0. The\ndifference of 3.70074341541719e-17 will be partioned across all noted alleles\n\nhead(fake101)\n\n  Population ID   AML  ATPS    EF    EN  LTRS  MP20   WNT   ZMP\n1        101  1 11:11 02:02 01:01 03:03 02:02 13:13 01:01 01:01\n2        101  2 08:11 02:02 01:01 01:01 01:02 12:13 01:01 01:01\n3        101  3 08:11 09:09 01:01 01:03 01:02 02:12 01:01 01:01\n4        101  4 08:08 02:02 01:02 01:03 02:02 11:13 01:01 01:01\n5        101  5 08:11 02:09 01:01 01:03 01:01 12:12 01:01 01:01\n6        101  6 08:08 02:04 02:02 01:01 02:02 12:12 01:01 01:01\n\n\nThe frequencies should be pretty close to the real ones. Compare the LTRS locus allele frequencies from the simualted data\n\nfrequencies( fake101,loci = \"LTRS\") \n\n  Locus Allele Frequency\n1  LTRS     01      0.28\n2  LTRS     02      0.72\n\n\nand the real data\n\nsim_freqs %>% filter(Locus==\"LTRS\", Stratum==\"101\")\n\n  Stratum Locus Allele Frequency\n1     101  LTRS     01 0.2777778\n2     101  LTRS     02 0.7222222\n\n\nPretty close. So using this approach, we can make all kinds of allele random populations. You just need to figure out the allele frequency matrix and then pass that to the appropriate functions."

If they are the same column names then the function will do it automagically, if no common names are found in the names() of either data.frame objects, you can specify the columns using the optional by.x= and by.y= function arguments.\n\n\nHere is an example. I’m going to load in some data from the\npopgraph library. First, I’ll load up the library and hten grab the population meta data for the lophocereus data set we analyzed in Dyer & Nason (2004).\nrequire(popgraph)\ndata(baja)\nsummary(baja)\n    Region     Population    Latitude       Longitude     \n Baja  :16   BaC    : 1   Min.   :22.93   Min.   :-114.7  \n Sonora:13   Cabo   : 1   1st Qu.:24.45   1st Qu.:-112.6  \n             CP     : 1   Median :27.95   Median :-111.8  \n             Ctv    : 1   Mean   :27.33   Mean   :-111.8  \n             ELR    : 1   3rd Qu.:29.59   3rd Qu.:-110.7  \n             IC     : 1   Max.   :31.95   Max.   :-109.5  \n             (Other):23                                   \n\nThe graph itself has nodes indicated as populations and perhaps we are interested in plotting node size as a function of spatial location. We can grab the names and sizes from the popgraph object (it is a kind of igraph ) by:\ndata(lopho)\ndf.nodes <- data.frame( Population=V(lopho)$name, Size=V(lopho)$size )\nsummary(df.nodes)\n   Population      Size       \n BaC    : 1   Min.   : 2.500  \n CP     : 1   1st Qu.: 5.291  \n Ctv    : 1   Median : 6.860  \n LaV    : 1   Mean   : 7.770  \n LF     : 1   3rd Qu.:10.925  \n Lig    : 1   Max.   :16.001  \n (Other):15\nNow we have baja and df.nodes as two data.frames and can merge them by their common column `Population`. If we merge df.nodesonto baja then we get the new data.frame:\nmerge( baja, df.nodes )\n   Population Region Latitude Longitude      Size\n1         BaC   Baja    26.59   -111.79 12.158810\n2          CP Sonora    27.95   -110.66  7.870725\n3         Ctv   Baja    29.73   -114.72  3.880886\n4         LaV   Baja    24.04   -109.99  3.533757\n5          LF Sonora    30.68   -112.27  8.472215\n6         Lig   Baja    25.73   -111.27  4.731355\n7          PL Sonora    30.39   -112.58  6.692795\n8         PtC   Baja    24.19   -111.15  4.684652\n9         PtP   Baja    29.03   -113.90 10.925375\n10     SenBas Sonora    31.95   -112.87  9.116705\n11       Seri Sonora    28.88   -111.96  2.500000\n12         SG Sonora    29.40   -112.05 11.027530\n13         SI Sonora    29.75   -112.50 11.521450\n14        SLG   Baja    29.59   -114.40  5.955645\n15         SN Sonora    28.82   -111.80  8.325785\n16        SnE   Baja    24.45   -110.70 11.828220\n17        SnF   Baja    30.76   -114.73  6.325655\n18        SnI   Baja    27.29   -113.02  5.466695\n19        StR   Baja    24.91   -111.62  6.859545\n20         TS Sonora    28.41   -111.37 16.001165\n21        TsS   Baja    23.58   -110.34  5.290570\nbut if we do it the other way, we get:\nmerge(df.nodes,baja)\n   Population      Size Region Latitude Longitude\n1         BaC 12.158810   Baja    26.59   -111.79\n2          CP  7.870725 Sonora    27.95   -110.66\n3         Ctv  3.880886   Baja    29.73   -114.72\n4         LaV  3.533757   Baja    24.04   -109.99\n5          LF  8.472215 Sonora    30.68   -112.27\n6         Lig  4.731355   Baja    25.73   -111.27\n7          PL  6.692795 Sonora    30.39   -112.58\n8         PtC  4.684652   Baja    24.19   -111.15\n9         PtP 10.925375   Baja    29.03   -113.90\n10     SenBas  9.116705 Sonora    31.95   -112.87\n11       Seri  2.500000 Sonora    28.88   -111.96\n12         SG 11.027530 Sonora    29.40   -112.05\n13         SI 11.521450 Sonora    29.75   -112.50\n14        SLG  5.955645   Baja    29.59   -114.40\n15         SN  8.325785 Sonora    28.82   -111.80\n16        SnE 11.828220   Baja    24.45   -110.70\n17        SnF  6.325655   Baja    30.76   -114.73\n18        SnI  5.466695   Baja    27.29   -113.02\n19        StR  6.859545   Baja    24.91   -111.62\n20         TS 16.001165 Sonora    28.41   -111.37\n21        TsS  5.290570   Baja    23.58   -110.34\nHope this helps."

    "text": "Opportunistic conspecific brood parasitism in a box-nesting population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea)\n\nConspecific brood parasitism, while prevalent in some avian taxa, is easily overlooked in when it occurs low frequencies and therefore the ecology of this behavior has been only occasionally described in passerines. Here we describe the occurrence of conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) in a population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding in nest boxes, demonstrate associated fitness costs, and investigate parasite strategy. We genotyped individuals at six microsatellite loci and used CERVUS to determine log-likelihood of maternity (LOD scores) for offspring and social mothers. We set critical cut-off LOD scores at 95% confidence for exclusion of the social mother and assignment of a parasite mother from the breeding population. Of 805 nestlings (233 family groups from 2009 to 2013), we found that 12.7% had incompatible genotypes with their social mother. Females with unrelated nestlings (hosts) fledged fewer biological offspring within the host year than non-host females despite fledging more total offspring, but being a host was not significantly associated with total reproductive success over five years of breeding. We were able to identify only ~30% of parasite females, suggesting that the majority of parasites may be floaters (i.e. non-nesters) in the population or nesting in nearby natural cavities. We found no evidence of host selection based on host age, arrival at the breeding site, or nest box productivity in the previous year. This opportunistic behavior is likely facilitated by the nesting ecology of this population, in that nest sites are limited, conspicuous, and relatively dense. Future studies investigating CBP in populations using natural cavities can help elucidate the drivers of this behavior."

    "text": "OK, now that I have moved over most of the manuscripts from the previous site, it comes time to move over some of the older posts. Many of these posts are important as there is code and data associated with them that I’d like to have access to going forward.\nLike before, however, there is some futzing around that needs to be done. However, this time, I took a different appraoch. I was less concerned about keeping the category information and all of them were authored by myself, so what I did was:\n\nPick out a set of 100 or so entries to keep.\n\nMove them into a top-level folder called old_posts.\n\nRead them in, one at a time, and extracted the title and date.\nCreated a new post using distill::create_post() using that date and title.\n\nPasted the contents of the markdown (skipping all the YAML crazyness) on the end of the new post (n.b., did you know that you could use cat() to concatenate onto the end of a file on the filesystem? I didn’t!).\n\nSo here is the basic code I used for it.\n\nrm(list = ls())\nlibrary( distill )\nlibrary( stringr )\n\nfiles <- list.files(\n  path = \"old_posts\",\n  pattern = \"index.Rmd\",\n  recursive = TRUE,\n  full.names = TRUE\n)\n\nfor (file in files) {\n  print(file)\n  lines <- readLines(file)\n  \n  # find the date \n  idx <- grep( \"date: \", lines, fixed = TRUE)\n  date <- \"\"\n  \n  if (length(idx) == 1) {\n    date <- str_sub( lines[idx], 7, 16)\n  }\n  \n  # Find the second --- and put in the output type\n  idx <- grep(\"---\", lines, fixed = TRUE)\n  content <- \"\"\n  lines <- c(lines, \" \", \" \", \" \")\n  if (length(idx) == 2) {\n    content <- paste( lines[ (idx[2]+1):length(lines) ] , \n                      collapse = \"\\n\")\n  }\n  \n  # find the title\n  idx <- grep(\"title: \", lines, fixed=TRUE )\n  title <- \"No Title\"\n  if( length(idx)>0 ) { \n    title <- str_trim( gsub('[[:punct:] ]+', \n                            \" \", \n                            str_remove(lines[idx], \"title: \")))\n  }\n  \n  ofile <- str_replace_all( tolower(title),  \n                            pattern=\" \", \n                            replacement = \"-\" ) \n  nfile <- paste(date, ofile, sep=\"-\") \n  path <- paste(\"_posts/\",\n                nfile,\n                \"/\", \n                ofile, \n                \".Rmd\", sep=\"\")\n\n  if( !file.exists(path) ) { \n\n    distill::create_post( title[1], \n                          collection=\"posts\", \n                          date = date, \n                          date_prefix=date, \n                          edit = FALSE)\n    cat( content, \n         file = path, \n         append=TRUE, \n         sep=\"\\n\")  \n  }\n}\n\nBut the problem is that when we use distill::createpost(), it puts in the following default content into the markdown. And then I just appended the original content onto the end of it.\n\n\n\nDefault distill post content\n\n\nSo I did a quick global search and replace using my favorite TextMate and then ran the following code to render it all out and looking good.\n\nfor( file in list.files(path=\"_posts/\", \n                        pattern = \"*.Rmd\",\n                        recursive = TRUE,\n                        full.names = TRUE) ) { \n  \n  rmarkdown::render( file )  \n}\n\n\nQuestions?\n\n\n\nPeter Sellers"

    "text": "Literate Programming\n\n\nI believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works of literature. Hence, my title Literate Programming.\n\n\nKnuth – 1992\n\n\nIf you think of it a bit, as data scientists, the documents and manuscripts we work on every day are just extensions of programs and scripts we use to do our work. However, in academia we are taught the process in entirely the wrong sequence. Traditionally, we are taught the following sequence.\n\nWe’ve are funneled by the primary interface for writing scientific documents–the word processor–into that monstrous chunk of software we use to crafted our tales about the data we were presenting. How many times have we started working on a new project and the first thing we do is fire up a editor and start an outline of a manuscript? We never really liked it but this was the main tool we were taught to use (and the crappy reference managers tacked onto them).\nIn a separate interface, we would perform our analyses. In my career, I’ve used:\n\nThat VAX machine over in the Math Department at UMSL. It ran SAS and I did most of my work in IML.\nOne-off software packages that worked on our ‘special’ kind of data we are working with. These were typically FORTRAN code written by some wizard at a far-off university. Anyone remember BioSYS from Swofford & Selander?\nWorkarounds in C (my own popgraph software is written in C).\nExtensions that could be shoved into Excel (GenAlEx is a good example of how far you can push VB).\nScripting languages such as R, Perl (no one uses this one any longer, which is probably a good thing), Python, Julia, etc.\n\nThen we would export the raw output to some kind of plotting software to make your graphics. I always hated this step, because inevitably, we’d have to come back and redo the graphics (higher DPI says the publisher) and we’d have to remember how we made it that last time as most of these interfaces are stupid point-and-click software packages.\n\nThe main problem is that any iteration of the manuscript would require manually going through the process or changing the text document, rerunning the analysis, then replotting the figures. Move this section up her and then go back through and make sure all your figure and table references are recovered.\nBut this is entirely upside-down! Instead of Communicate -> Analysis -> Visualize, our workflow should be more like:\n\n\n\nData science workflow\n\n\nWe should be data-focused, not manuscript focused!\n\n\nThe research manuscript is simply an advertisement of our research and the data, it IS NOT the research or data.\n\n\nDyer – Just now!"

    "text": "PWeave\nPWeave is like SWeave (and its better version Knitr) on R. It is a tool that we can use to interdigitate our analysis and how we go about presenting it all in one place. This allows us to have a single document where we can have the data, the analyses, the output, and the verbiage that we use to describe what we are doing. This tight coupling of the data to the rest of the components helps in Reproducible Research.\nTo install Pweave, you need to have atom and python already configured. Then in Atom, install the following packages\n\nlanguage-weave\nHydrogen\nlanguage-markdown\nplatformio-ide-terminal\n\nNext, you can prepare a short script. Here is a fragment of one.\n\n\n\nRaw pweave document.\n\n\n\nWhat this does is mix in markdown text and code. If you have not used Markdown before, it is pretty straight forward. Here are some simple rules.\n\n\nA line with one or more # marks are headings.\nA word or bit of text between asterisks (e.g., *this*) are italicized.\nA word or bit of text between pairs of asterisks (e.g., **this**) are bold.\nLinks are placed in parentheses with the option to have specific word to be the link. [link](http://foo.bar)\nLists are done physically, new line with dash for unordered or new line with number as numeric.\n\nAll the python code must be within the bounds marked by the three backslashes. The code will be evaluated, from the top of the document to the bottom. You do not have to show the code for it to run.\nTo weave the document into HTML (we can do other formats as well but this gets us going, open the terminal and type:\npweave.exe test1.pmd\nAnd it should produce a document in the same folder but as an *.html file.\n\n\n\nWhich is pretty cool. Now, there are a lot more things you can do with markdown."

As in Buddhism, things that suck are ultimately the things in your life that cause suffering. Suffering is inevitable and part of the human experience. Some people even seem to be needing suffering as a condition of existence (my grandparents for example-loved to be miserable).\nIn the modern age, the kinds of things that suck include (but are not limited to):\n\nRunning out of ink on your printer the morning your paper is due,\nBeing a Cleveland Browns fan,\nStevia,\nWaking up 45 minutes before your alarm goes off,\nPop Music,\nThe Windows Operating System,\nStepping in cat hairballs in the middle of the night,\nFinding that door dash delivered you the veggie burger instead of the dozen wings.\n\nI’m sure there are many additional things you can add to this list.\nSo it is also true that the “rest of that stuff in your life” is a pretty big grab-bag of items. That is OK. As long as each of them do not suck in any way, they can stay in this category. However, it is important that you look at these items often and Marie Condo them to see if they actually do suck but you’ve ignored them mostly because the amount of sucking they contribute to is only marginally larger than zero.\nBe vigilant! Do not let these things persist in this state. You MUST eradicate and exile them to the “Suck” category. Failing to do so results in condition called Suck Creep, which through time, will slowly eat all of your non-sucking life parts and eventually your life will consist of 100% suck."

Now, suppose that through some deep introspection and honest reflection on your part, you can identify 25% of the things in that category.\nThat situation looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, here is the solemn truth of this entire philosophy. If you can look at these things and:\n\nRemove then from your life (e.g., stop using Windows),\nGive them to someone else (e.g., rehome the cat), or\nReconfigure your life so they no longer live rent free in your head (e.g., become a Seattle Seahawks fan)\n\nThen you can achieve what is technically called a period of suckiness reduction. These things are not guaranteed to stay static without constant vigilance. However, your life after this reduction will be more like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you will, by definition, have reduce the amount of suckiness in your life (compare this graph and the one above).

I used to get mine from\nKyngchaos, just download the framework, install it, and then do some kind of long R CMD INSTALL dance, which seems to no longer work for me. I also tried installing from Ripley’s repository and found that (a) It was a version older than the one I already had on my machine, and (b) you can’t install from that repository , there is a malformed header and the install.packages() function just barfs.\nTime to try something new. I typically stay away from the various installer frameworks out there on OSX to keep everything in Frameworks. But this time, I used MacPorts. You can find the latest version here. Here is how I got it to help me out.\n\nDownloaded the version for my OS, I’m currently on 10.10 and installed it.\nIn the terminal, I updated it sudo port -v selfupdate\nI then used it to install gdal as a unix library (rather than as a framework so it won’t be located in /Library/Frameworks) by sudo port install gdal. There were a lot of dependencies for this one so it took a while.\nI then had R install rgdal as install.packages( rgdal, type=”source”)\nWorked like a charm."
