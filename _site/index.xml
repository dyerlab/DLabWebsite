  <title>Emydine Conservation Symposium</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-07-11-Emydine_Conservation_Symposium/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It was the first time that I attended and presented at a herp meeting, and it was a great experience. Such a great group of reserachers, agency people, law enforcement, and zoo personnel, all working on projects related to this group of turtles. Really cool experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-07-11-Emydine_Conservation_Symposium/heading.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I was asked to provide an overview of what we’ve been doing in the spotted turtle genetic work. The conference had a tremendously wide variety of topics surrounding these species. Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aWJoShwHJGKQt-I4wdEfj1YY2jxm0Khg/view?usp=sharing">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to myself, there were two other genetics presentations by <a href="https://www.pfw.edu/about-pfw/who-we-are/directories/mark-jordan">Mark Jordan</a> talking about <em>Patterns of standing Genetic variation and Effective population size in Blanding’s Turtle Populations</em> and another by <a href="https://www.umt.edu/environment/personnel/faculty.php?ID=4461">Andrew Whitley</a> on <em>Population genetic analysis of the wood turtle across its us native range.</em> Both of these talks were really well delivered, informative and inspiring.</p>
<p>Here are my slides that I presented along with co-authors <a href="https://dyerlab.org/people">Madison Whitehurst</a> and <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/caleb-krueger">Caleb Krueger</a>.</p>

<p>It was really nice to get up into the semi-mountainous areas in Pennsylvania (and out of the more humid piedmont of Virginia) for a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-05-15-gstudio-1.6.0/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="version-1.6.0" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="version-1.6.0">Version 1.6.0</h2>
<p>The fixes in this latest version include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[REQ] Test for HWP and LD similar to that implemented in Genepop? I work with microsatellite loci that have many rare alleles, so a HWP/LD test with a MC algorithm similar to that used in Genepop would be ideal</p></li>
<li><p>[ADD] Added heirfstat to <code>genetic_structure()</code> to allow functional calling</p></li>
<li><p>[ADD] Added hooks into genetic distances from pegas through <code>genetic_distance()</code> for other distance measures.</p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] stratum He/Ho genetic_diversity <code>Hs()</code></p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] Add permutation to <code>Fst()</code> for significance</p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] <code>pies_on_map</code> apparently is broken</p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] Problem with having a missing genotype for <code>type="column"</code> in first row. Odd problem.</p></li>
<li><p>[ADD] Feedback for reading in columns for <code>read_population()</code> when &gt; 500 loci to provide some level of feedback to the user showing it is doing something and not just sitting there.</p></li>
<li><p>[ADD] Added <code>Hi()</code> (individual heterozygosity) function.</p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] Change ‘locus’ to ‘loci’ in <code>frequency_matrix()</code> to be consistent with the frequencies() function argument list.</p></li>
<li><p>[FIX] Catching problem where empty (instead of <code>NA</code>) data was causing <code>locus(.,type="separated")</code> to fail.</p></li>
</ul>

  <title>Population Assignment for Confiscated Spotted Turtles</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-04-27-Population-Assignment/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Population assignment is the process of determining the likelihood of an individual from originating from a set of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> populations.</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-04-27-Population-Assignment/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In reality though, confiscated animals are probably not collected from any of the locales from which you’ve sampled to get the allele frequency spectra. So, one goes about the process by using the sample locations to create an assignment surface, showing where <strong>in general</strong> the samples probably came from. Here is just such an application for the endangered turtle species <em>Clemmys guttata</em>.</p>

  <title>Full Data Run</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-24-full-dataset/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-24-full-dataset/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>At present, we have 1318 individuals processed and I am waiting on the final 120~ish to finish up this weekend. While these last few are processed and SNPs are called, I am starting to get them configured for analysis (as in actually being able to get answers to this tremendously drawn out process).</p>
<p>This is not the full data set, this is a random subset of the data that has been derived due to time constraints. These data consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 5% random sample of each individuals sequences.</li>
<li>Mapped onto a conservative <em>de novo</em> reference genome assembly that contains only 6,676 contigs. This reference genome was created from 2.5% random sample of each individuals genome as well. See <a href="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-ddradseq-progress/">this post</a> for more about the assembly and why we chose to use this sized assembly as a reference.</li>
</ul>
<section id="filtering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filtering">Filtering</h2>
<p>To start with, we need to filter the loci. In the current data, we have identified 19,879 sites of potential interest. Next, we filter these down by throwing away ones that do not conform to some rigid tests designed to minimize errors (sequencing errors, etc.). Using <code>vcftools</code>, the first pass of the data was done considering only SNP loci (no sites in insertion/deletion locations), sites with sufficiently high sequencing quality scores (to ensure confidence in identity of nucleotide called by the sequencing machine), sites that have at least 5 individuals possesing a copy of the minor allele (to ignore singletons and rare variants), and with enough sequencing depth (e.g., multiple sequences that are identical) to ensure that we’ve got good genomic regions that are free from any sequencing errors, and have only 2 alleles at the locus.</p>
<p>The table below shows how these filtering options reduced the number of potential sites.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Filter</th>
<th>Sites</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Raw</td>
<td>19,879</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>QUAL &gt; 20</td>
<td>15,930</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>MAC &gt; 5</td>
<td>10,627</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Depth 10X</td>
<td>1,004</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2 - alleles</td>
<td>926</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From these, I extracted the following derivative components. - site Allele frequencies - site Sequencing depth - site HWE estimates</p>
<p>Then I finished by exporting the filtered data in <code>012</code> allele format and imported it into <code>R</code> using <a href="https://github.com/dyerlab/gstudio/">gstudio</a>.</p>

  <title>Removing .DS_Store</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-23-remove-ds-store/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On MacOS, an invisible file named <code>.DS_Store</code> (it is invisible because it starts with a period) can be found in any folder that has some modifications to basic layouts. This is where the metadata is stored that governs view preferences to this folder, icon placement, and other things related to how a user may have customized or modified the appearance of a folder or any manipulation in the Finder.app.</p>
<p>This is all find and dandy until you start doing things like keeping repositories of folders of work in <code>R</code> or other languages using a versioning system like <code>git</code>. As it turns out, these files often change and as such will end up being archived in your add-commit-push workflow. Here is how I get rid of them.</p>
<p>First change to the directory of your repository in the <code>Terminal.app</code> or if you are using <code>RStudio</code>, open the Terminal there in your project (you are using projects, right?).</p>
<pre><code>cd MY_REPO</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can find any and all of them that are currently in the directory tree using the <code>find</code> command. Here are the results of my blog repository.</p>
<pre><code>$ find . -name ".DS_Store"
./manuscripts/apsit-et-al-2002/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/tassone-et-al-2020/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/friedline-et-al-2019/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/flores-manzanero-et-al-2019/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/baker-dyer-2011/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/kelly-dyer-2002/.DS_Store
./manuscripts/smouse-et-al-2001/.DS_Store
./posts/2023-02-20-processing-bam-files/.DS_Store
./posts/2023-02-23-full-dataset/.DS_Store
./posts/.DS_Store
./posts/2022-09-01-markdown/.DS_Store
./posts/2023-02-20-screen-scrolling/.DS_Store
./posts/2023-02-14-Variant-Filtering/.DS_Store
./posts/2022-09-07-Rendering-R-Helpfiles/.DS_Store
./images/.DS_Store</code></pre>
<p>If you have some (such as I did) delete them in a similar manner by appending <code>-delete</code> to the find command.</p>
<pre><code>find . -iname ".DS_Store" -delte</code></pre>
<p>Next, if had previously add any of these into your repository, you will see them as deleted in your git status output. If they are are there, commit the change for deletion as you would normally.</p>
<p>Now, open up your <code>.gitignore</code> file, which should be in the root directory of your repository. If you do not have one, then create one. This file tells <code>git</code> which file patterns to ignore in the future (cryptic naming scheme, no?).</p>
<p>Add <code>.DS_Store</code> on its own line then commit its change. Here is what my <code>.gitignore</code> looks like for this blog repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-23-remove-ds-store/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Add your messages and push these commits up to your repository.</p>
<p>You should never have to deal with this again, .DS_Store files will show up but git will never see them.</p>

  <title>First Filtering Pass for SNP Calling</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-22-first-pass/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">library</span>( tidyverse)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>First, I took the new data and made in index and then verged it with the previous VCF files (from <a href="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-14-variant-filtering/">here</a>). I set up filtering to have a minimum <code>QUAL</code> score of 20, no insertion/deletions, minimum allele count of 5 indiviudals posessing the alternative allele state to have the loci be considered, and only loci with 2 alleles present.</p>
<pre><code>#| eval: false
$ bgzip TotalRawSNPs.vcf 
$ tabix -p vcf TotalRawSNPs.vcf.gz 
$ vcf-merge JK.vcf.gz P.vcf.gz R.vcf.gz S.vcf.gz W.vcf.gz TotalRawSNPs.vcf.gz &gt; FirstRun.vcf
$ vcftools --vcf FirstRun.vcf --remove-indels --minQ 20 --mac 5 --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2 --site-depth --out site_depth_summary

VCFtools - 0.1.16
(C) Adam Auton and Anthony Marcketta 2009

Parameters as interpreted:
        --vcf FirstRun.vcf
        --mac 2
        --max-alleles 2
        --min-alleles 2
        --minQ 20
        --out site_depth_summary
        --site-depth
        --remove-indels

After filtering, kept 1410 out of 1410 Individuals
Outputting Depth for Each Site
After filtering, kept 1055 out of a possible 26395 Sites
Run Time = 6.00 seconds</code></pre>
<p>So, I then looked at the distribution of site depths and found the value to cut off the upper 25% percentile. I then filtered all the sites with depth greater than 20X and 3662X. From that I took a look at the distribution of allele frequencies.</p>
<pre><code>vcftools --vcf FirstRun.vcf --remove-indels --minQ 20 --min-meanDP 20 --max-meanDP 3700 --mac 5 --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2  --freq --out first_run</code></pre>
<p>This gives me a distribution of loci whose allele frequencies are:</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-22-first-pass/filtered_maf.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>which leaves me with a reasonable number of loci to work with. At present, there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?663"> loci in the data set and if I were to filter at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%3E=0.05"> that would still leave me with 234 to work with. Now let’s convert these into genotypes and start looking at missing data.</p>

  <title>Run FreeBayes, Run!!</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-21-freebayes2/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-21-freebayes2/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So I have somewhere in the vicinity of 1117 samples left to do SNP calling. I thought that I’d just take them and randomly divide them up into 4 groups and then call SNPs on each group. This helps me overcome lack of variation within a particular population.</p>
<p>Here is how I set it up. I have already called SNPs on individuals whose populations start with the letter <em>S, P, J, K, R, and W</em>, so I’m going to exclude all of them.</p>

<p>This coppied over the raw forward and reverse directions for trimmed data, the <code>.bam</code> files for that were mapped onto the same reference, and the index files I recreated after moving stuff around.</p>
<p>I then fired up a <code>srun</code> for each of the folders and ran <code>dDocent</code> on them with no trim, no assembly, no mapping, and yes FreeBayes.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why there are such small amounts in <code>batch3</code> and <code>batch4</code>, so I’m just going to do them all in a single lump and see how that goes.</p>

<p>As a first pass through the data, I split individual sequences into different groups to run <code>bwa</code>. This works on an individual-by-individual basis and with 5% of each individuals genome takes roughly 30 minutes per individual (*1419 individuals …). Doing it in smaller groups allows me to run multiple instances at the same time. See the table <a href="../../posts/2023-01-ddRADSeq-Progress/">here</a> for the groups and current status. At the time of this writing, this process is still waiting on the final 6 groups of samples to be processed.</p>
<p>For a subset of the data, I did call SNPs at the same time that</p>

  34828     basic freebaye   rjdyer PD       0:00      1 (Priority)</code></pre>
<p>So, now lets see if it actually works. This run has 293 samples and the next one (#34828) has 270. <strong>Failed because <code>sbatch</code> didn’t work properly.</strong></p>

<p>For this, I wanted to sort, mark duplicates, and index each of the bam files we are working with. I softlinked all the bam files into a new folder called <code>processing</code> via <code>for file in ../samples/all005/*.bam; do ln -s $file; done</code>.</p>
<p>Then I fired up R and loaded the latest modeule on the server <code>module load R/4.1.2</code> and then hooked up VSCode over SSH to write the following snippet.</p>

<p>Running this made several derivded files for each one, a sorted one, a one with marked duplicates, and one that had the index on it. So now each sample looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>[rjdyer@huff10 4_processing]$ ls -1 Zoo_969*
Zoo_969-RG.bam -&gt; ../samples/all005/Zoo_969-RG.bam
Zoo_969-sorted.bam
Zoo_969-sorted-md.bam
Zoo_969-sorted-md.bam.bai</code></pre>
<p>After testing to make sure the commands were properly set up, I ran the script in as a batch. It didn’t take that long to finish, maybe 3-4 seconds per sample.</p>

  <title>Scrolling Back using ‘Screen’</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-20-screen-scrolling/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-20-screen-scrolling/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I use <code>screen</code> a lot to do stuff on remote servers and one of the things that annoyed me is that it appears that when you are in a <code>screen</code> session, and you flick the scroll wheel backwards, it simply goes back through the history of commands on the same command line. The indended behavior, would be like the normal terminal, when not in a <code>screen</code> session, and the terminal would scroll up/down..</p>
<p>Apparently <code>screen</code> has some kind of buffer that prevents this for reason I cannot tell you. To fix it, create a <code>.screenrc</code> file in your home directory (if it does not already exist) and put the following line of code in it.</p>
<pre><code>termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@</code></pre>
<p>Makes total sense, right? Sometimes I get so frustrated that things need to be so complicated. Simplicity people! Let’s focus on <a href="../../posts/1969-10-14-Dyers-Philosophy-Of-Life">removing stuff that sucks</a> from our lives!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="seting-up-r-and-vscode">Seting up R and VSCode</h2>
<p>First of all, we’ll need to install some stuff on the <code>R</code> side. The language serve is necessary for VSCode and the httpgd is helpful for viewing graphical output. The following code will check to see if you have them installed and if not, install them for you.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stderr">
<pre><code>Loading required package: httpgd</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> from the main server. You will also need to install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r">R Extension for Visual Studio Code</a>, which can be installed from inside VSCode.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll need to install the following items for VSCode:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh">Remote-ssh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have this set up, it is a pretty stratight forward exercise to follow VSCode prompts to get to work. For me, after logging into the remot server, I created an <code>R</code> file and basically followed the instructions given by VSCode on what needed to be instlled on the server instance side. It was all locally done so no big deal.</p>
<p>The only problem that I did run into is that for some reason, <code>jsonlite</code> would not install because of some python dependency problem.</p>
<pre><code>Failed to get list of R functions. Make sure that `jsonlite` is installed and r.rpath.linux points to a valid R executable.</code></pre>

<section id="merging-vcf-files" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="merging-vcf-files">Merging VCF Files</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to to is zip and then index the individual vcf files. As a reminder, these files have been created by individual <code>freebayes</code> SNP calling of chunks of individuals partitioned into groups based upon the first letter of the popualtion from which they were collected. So, in the following examples, the file <code>R.vcf</code> contains all the individuals in populations starting with the letter <code>R</code>. When there are not that many individuals in a group, they are clustered—below we have <code>JK.vcf</code> which has all the individuals from populations starting with the letters <code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>
<p>So, lets compress these raw files first.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Now we need to index these files.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

font-style: inherit;">-p</span> vcf W.vcf.gz</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we can merge the files together into a single file. Here, the output file indicates the populations that contribute to it.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"> <span class="ex" style="color: null;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&gt;</span> JKPRSW.vcf</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>So here are a few things that I’ve found that provide some insights into the data we are getting. Here is the sequencing depth per individual for only the SNP sites who have a minimum quality score of 20.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<p>This produced a distribution of sequencing depths for these individuals.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Alternatively—and perhaps more important for us—we can look at the per-site depths. The goal here is to retain sites that have enough sequencing depth such that we are confident that it is a good site but not too much such that it is a reapeaty region in the geniome. For simplicity, I’ll drop the lower and upper standard deviation.</p>

<p>This leaves us with 5047 sites.</p>
<p>Now, we can go back to <code>vcftools</code> and use these values to select only sites with a quality score exceeding 20, and are in the middle 50 percentile of the depth coverage and have a minor allele frequency of at least 5%.</p>

<p>I am sure there is a probability example that could be used here to look at where you break even on sequencing errors and joint probability of the same allele being <em>incorrectly</em> identified. Don’t quite want to work it out right now but I think my 5% (putting it just shy of the MAC=150) may have been a bit too stringent…</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filtering-on-depth">Filtering on Depth</h3>
<p>Next lets look at sequencing depth. Here i am going to fix the MAC=5 and cut off all the loci that have a depths in excess of the 90% in depths (see above) and then look at how many loci are recovered going from 5X coverage up to 200X (the example above had it set at a minimum coverage of 110X).</p>

  <title>Reset Github User for Push</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-16-github-reset-user/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-02-16-github-reset-user/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So I was working on a repository at home that I set up on another github acount, for another entity. In doing so, I clobbered my <code>global</code> github <code>user</code> and <code>user.email</code> values and as such when I tried to <code>git push</code> none of the changes would go because it could not authenticate. Instead I got this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rodney$</span> git push</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">remote:</span> Permission to dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git denied to windbunny.</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">fatal:</span> unable to access <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'https://github.com/dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git/'</span>: The requested URL returned error: 403</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, what you have to do is reconfigure the <code>username</code>, <code>user.email</code>, and <code>remote.origin.url</code> to reset your user name for ssh/https pushing.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rodney$</span> git config user.name dyerlab</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rodney$</span> git config user.email rjdyer@vcu.edu</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rodney$</span> git config remote.origin.url https://dyerlab@github.com/dyerlab/DLabWebsite.git</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then the next time you <code>push</code> it (go Salt-n-Pepper), it will ask for your authentication token again. Enter it and you are good.</p>

<p>The following logs document the initial attempts at implementing the <a href="https://www.ddocent.com">dDocent</a> workflow for processing NovoSEQ data on the spotted turtle.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../posts/2022-10-05-ddradseq">Demultiplexing</a> is the process of taking all the data that is mixed together and turning it inot a a bunch of files, one for each individual, based upon the individual barcodes.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../posts/2023-01-21-first-ddocent-run/">first run</a> of <a href="http://ddocent.com/">dDocent</a> crashed almost immediately.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../2023-01-25-second-ddocent-run/">second run</a> of <a href="http://ddocent.com/">dDocent</a> also crashed, but this time it was for a different reason. Apparently, the node it was running on was failing. However, it still crashed.</li>
<li>As a result of these attempts, it appears that the data are just <em>too big</em> and I need to take subsets of the data to work with so the computers can actually get something done. So, after talking with a colleague about it, I <a href="../../posts/2023-01-12-right-sizing-sequences/">right-sized</a> the data <em>first</em> in random samples and then ran a <a href="../../posts/2023-01-25-a-10percent-full-data-run/">third</a> run used a random subset of 10% of each individuals reads to make a synthetic “individual”. It ultimately failed at the end as well.</li>
<li>So, lessons learned. I needed to create a random subset of my data and use that for <strong>just</strong> the assembly portion of this process. So I set out to do that and found results.
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../posts/2023-01-30-2pt5pct-ddocent-run/">2.5% subset</a> finished with 7k contigs.</li>
<li>A <a href="../../posts/2023-01-31-5pct-ddocent-run/">5% subset</a> finished with 58k contigs.</li>
<li>A <a href="../../posts/2023-01-27-10pct-ddocent-run/">10% subset</a> finished with 400k contigs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So, I can now start mapping. At first, I took the reference genome from the <a href="../../posts/2023-01-30-2pt5pct-ddocent-run/">2.5% subset</a> and took the raw data again (all the reads for each indiviudal) and used <code>bwa</code> to assemble and <code>FreeBayes</code> to call SNPs. Unfortunately, since the number of reads for each individual is somewhere in the range of 3 - 33 million reads, it takes a bit of time. Right now, it is averaging 11 hours per individual * 1419 individuals which is 650.375 days (meaning it will be done on 2024-11-13). This run is still going and unless it dies at some point, I am going to allow it to keep running…</li>
<li>Again, to take a random subset seems to be the way to go. In what follows is my current approach to this, which started on 2 February 2022.</li>
</ul>
<section id="workflow-progress" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workflow-progress">Workflow Progress</h3>
<p>So I started up a individuals processes to map and call SNPs. It is done using <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com">slurm</a> on our clusters so I fire up an instance on one of the compute nodes as:</p>
<p>As a first mapping run, I had a single process (that one used 64G of memory and was way too much for what <code>bwa</code> and <code>FreeBayes</code> seem to need). The data being used in this run include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new random selection of 5% of each individuals genome.<br>
</li>
<li>The assembly created from the 2.5% random selection of each individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was started on 2 February 2023 and appears to be taking roughly 30 minutes per indivudal to allow <code>bwa</code> to map. Below is the progress to date.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>So given the output from [[dDocent All Individuals 2.5%]] and [[dDocent All Individuals 10%]], I thought I’d run a 5% representation.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-r</span> 3222</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and sample them as:</p>
<pre><code>rm(list=ls())
files &lt;- list.files("all",pattern="F.fq.gz")

for( i in 1:length(files) ) {&nbsp;
    file &lt;- files[i]
    tmp &lt;- strsplit(file, split="\\.")[[1]]
    ofile &lt;- paste( &nbsp; paste(tmp[1],tmp[2],sep=""), tmp[3],tmp[4], sep=".")
    cmd &lt;- paste( "seqtk sample ./all/",file," 0.025 &gt; ./all0025/", ofile, sep="")
    system(cmd)
    cmd &lt;- paste("gzip ", "./all0025/",ofile,sep="")
    system(cmd)
    cat( format(i/length(files), digits=3), " ", ofile, "\n")
}</code></pre>
<ul>

<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-31-5pct-dDocent-Run/image_1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I set it to only record sequences if they are in 10% of the individuals in the full dataset.</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-31-5pct-dDocent-Run/image_2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<pre><code>At this point, all configuration information has been entered and dDocent may take several hours to run.

It is recommended that you move this script to a background operation and disable terminal input and output.

All data and logfiles will still be recorded.

To do this:
Press **control** and **Z** simultaneously
Type **bg** and press enter
Type **disown -h** and press enter
Now sit back, relax, and wait for your analysis to finish
dDocent assembled 88487 sequences (after cutoffs) into 57829 contigs

dDocent has finished with an analysis in /lustre/home/rjdyer/clemgu/samples/all005  

dDocent started Tue Jan 31 18:21:35 EST 2023

dDocent finished Wed Feb 1 07:20:00 EST 2023</code></pre>

  <title>A 2.5% dDocent Run</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-30-2pt5pct-dDocent-Run/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>So, started again with a smaller amount of starting data. This time, I set the random sample to 2.5% of the sequences from each individual. Instructions for how I did that are <a href="../../posts/2023-01-12-Right-Sizing-Sequences/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It took about 3 hours to do this plus another 2 hours to gzip all the data files.</p>

  <title>A 10% dDocent Run</title>
  <link>https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-27-10pct-dDocent-Run/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-27-10pct-dDocent-Run/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So this time I made a small representation of the overall sequences, using: - 10% of each individual - Renamed to not have period in population name for each state (thinking that may be why I’ve had failures in the past). - Saved to different folder.</p>
<pre><code>rm(list=ls())

files &lt;- list.files("all",pattern="F.fq.gz")
for( i in 1:length(files) ) {
    file &lt;- files[i]
    tmp &lt;- strsplit(file, split="\\.")[[1]]
    ofile &lt;- paste( paste( tmp[1],
                                 tmp[2],
                                 sep=""), 
                        tmp[3], tmp[4], tmp[5], sep=".")
    cmd &lt;- paste("seqtk sample ./all/",
                     file,
                     " 0.10 | gzip &gt; ./all010/", 
                     ofile, 
                     sep="")
    system(cmd)
    cat( format(i/length(files), digits=3), " ", ofile, "\n")
}</code></pre>
<p>It ran for a while, then died. So I tried it again and there were some issues with dDocent not recognizing the the files as being <code>gz</code> files… So I had to unzip all the 10% individuals and redo them.</p>
<p>Finally it went through but I got a few errors along the way.</p>
<pre><code>Trimming reads and simultaneously assembling reference sequences

Removing the _1 character and replacing with /1 in the name of every sequence
parallel: Warning: Starting 16 processes took &gt; 2 sec.
parallel: Warning: Consider adjusting -j. Press CTRL-C to stop.</code></pre>
<p>Then it gave me the prompt for number of unique sequences per individual.</p>
<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-27-10pct-dDocent-Run/image_1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">Please choose data cutoff. In essence, you are picking a <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-27-10pct-dDocent-Run/image_2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I had hit the return button a few times and it ran using some ‘default’ value.</p>
<p>This time it did finish and made contigs.</p>
<pre><code>At this point, all configuration information has been entered and dDocent may take several hours to run.

It is recommended that you move this script to a background operation and disable terminal input and output.

All data and logfiles will still be recorded.
To do this:
Press **control** and **Z** simultaneously
Type **bg** and press enter
Type **disown -h** and press enter
Now sit back, relax, and wait for your analysis to finish

dDocent assembled 969927 sequences (after cutoffs) into 394146 contigs
  
Using BWA to map reads</code></pre>
<p>So at this point, I let it run for a while longer and then realized I was not going to use the 10% representation and would be using another assembly. So I killed the mapping.</p>

<p>Let’s go look through these data and see where the problem is with our current output. If you look at the first line, it is looking for a file</p>
<pre><code>$sort -k1 -r -n --parallel=$NUMProc -S 2G uniq.k.$CUTOFF.c.$CUTOFF2.seqs |cut -f2 &gt; totaluniqseq</code></pre>
<p>which in our case has no data in it. Here are our data files.</p>
<pre><code>-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer  0 Jan 26 09:18 totaluniqseq
-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer  0 Jan 25 13:34 trim.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 rjdyer rjdyer 4.0K Jan 25 15:20 trim_reports
-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer 1.2G Jan 26 09:16 uniqCperindv
-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer  0 Jan 26 09:18 uniq.full.fasta
-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer  0 Jan 26 09:16 uniq.k.4.c.4.seqs

-rw-rw-r--. 1 rjdyer rjdyer  0 Jan 26 09:08 uniqseq.peri.data</code></pre>
<p>So, there is nothing in <code>uniq.k.4.c.4.seqs</code> to look at. I think when we are doing this ‘synthetic use 10% of all individuals’ we cannot say that we would like it to be in X&gt;1 individual, because we only have 1 individual.</p>
<p><strong>So lets start dDocent over, without trimming, and select 1X for the number of individuals…</strong></p>

<p>So, the problem here is that I’ve been putting all the random sequences into a single individual and the assembly is dying because it is looking for stuff that is present in more than <em>X</em> number of individuals.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyerlab.org/posts/2023-01-25-Second-dDocent-Run/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This time, I made discussed things with Mike Davis and then tried this.</p>
<pre><code>[rjdyer@huff all]$ srun --nodes=1 --mem=128G --export=ALL -J assembly --pty /bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>I was able to get onto the compute node and then start up a run of dDocent with the following data: - All the samples. - 256 processors per node - Trim - Assemble as Single End (SE) reads - Map the individual to the assembly - SNP call on individuals.</p>
<section id="the-printout." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-printout.">The Printout.</h2>
<pre><code>[rjdyer@huff12 all]$ dDocent
dDocent 2.9.4

Checking for required software

All required software is installed!

dDocent version 2.9.4 started Tue Jan 24 10:11:43 EST 2023

1419 individuals are detected. Is this correct? Enter yes or no and press [ENTER]
yes
Proceeding with 1419 individuals
dDocent detects 256 processors available on this system.
Please enter the maximum number of processors to use for this analysis.
256

Do you want to quality trim your reads?
Type yes or no and press [ENTER]?
yes

Do you want to perform an assembly?
Type yes or no and press [ENTER].
yes
What type of assembly would you like to perform?  Enter SE for single end, PE for paired-end, RPE for paired-end sequencing for RAD protocols with random shearing, or OL for paired-end sequencing that has substantial overlap.
Then press [ENTER]
SE
Reads will be assembled with Rainbow
CD-HIT will cluster reference sequences by similarity. The -c parameter (% similarity to cluster) may need to be changed for your taxa.
Would you like to enter a new c parameter now? Type yes or no and press [ENTER]
yes
Please enter new value for c. Enter in decimal form (For 90%, enter 0.9)
.85
Do you want to map reads?  Type yes or no and press [ENTER]
yes
BWA will be used to map reads.  You may need to adjust -A -B and -O parameters for your taxa.
Would you like to enter a new parameters now? Type yes or no and press [ENTER]
yes
Please enter new value for A (match score).  It should be an integer.  Default is 1.
1
Please enter new value for B (mismatch score).  It should be an integer.  Default is 4.
4
Please enter new value for O (gap penalty).  It should be an integer.  Default is 6.
6
Do you want to use FreeBayes to call SNPs?  Please type yes or no and press [ENTER]
yes

Please enter your email address.  dDocent will email you when it is finished running.
Dont worry; dDocent has no financial need to sell your email address to spammers.
rjdyer@vcu.edu


dDocent will require input during the assembly stage.  Please wait until prompt says it is safe to move program to the background.

<p>So, again, I am experiencing some problems on the servers. Our server admin person, Mike Davis, did follow up with some comments that one of the servers we were running on was experiencing some odd behaviors…</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
